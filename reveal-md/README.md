# PBA [`reveal-md`](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md) template

**See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to use this software**

## TODO

- [ ] set a ` --listing-template <filename> Template file for listing` used in the top level page for all slide decks (eventually replace with a popper nav in a more complete mono repo of materials for the academy)
- [ ] Fix background, not a static image, but elements that live over the rest of the page
- [x] Get 2 colum working
- [x] favicon.ico working
- [ ] more plugins (from a custom template per slide type {math vs no math} is better likely) https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md/issues/102#issuecomment-692494366 -- possibly math from latex https://revealjs.com/math/
- [ ] custom div to wrap slides of particular format, like a code view
