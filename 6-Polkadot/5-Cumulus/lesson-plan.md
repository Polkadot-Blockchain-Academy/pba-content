## Lesson 2: Cumulus

### Why is this topic Important?

-

### Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills

- Understand PoV and it's costs
- A complete Substrate chain with pallets, that could be in production (Polkadot)

### Learning Outcome

- Understand how Cumulus enables parachian functionality for Substrate chains.
- Be able to integrate cumulus into your parachain.
- Convert a solochain into a parachain (port logic/pallets), ensure that youfit into strick confines of parachains in weights

### Learning Objectives

-

### Core Ideas to Convey

- What Cumulus is and provides for you
- Extension to Substrate that makes substrate chains able to be used as parachains
- Substrate doesn't know what parachains are
- Most substrate is written generically for stand-alone blockchains; Cumulus gives you the tools to take a Substrate and convert it into a parachain

- What can you NOT use from Substrate if you use cumulus?
- What does Cumulus actually contain
- How do you create a parachain from scratch using cumulus?
- How can you convert a solo chain into a parachain?
