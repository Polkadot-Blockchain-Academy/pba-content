<aside class="notes"><p>What is covered in this course is all connected subjects.
We will not cover any details for hybrid or interactive protocols in the course.</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Operating Context

##### _Protocols use resources and cryptography ensures that they provide security guarantees_

- **Network, storage, computation, etc.**: We want to specify guarantees on what the resources provide.

<pba-flex center>

- Stored/transmitted data is untampered,<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Transmitted data comes from a specific sender,<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- A computation over data has been performed correctly,<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- Sensitive data does not get leaked,<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
- and many more...<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->

</pba-flex>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Operating Context: Example

##### _The internet is a public space_

We communicate over public channels.
Adversaries may want to:

<pba-flex center>

- Read messages not intended for them<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->
- Impersonate others<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

## Public vs. Private Systems

_Cryptography based on public systems is more sound_

**Kerckhoff's Principle:** Security should not rely on secret _methods_,<br/>but rather on secret _information_

<aside class="notes"><p>There is no such thing as a &quot;closed channel&quot; :)</p>
<ul>
<li>Methods can be reverse engineered.
After that, the communication channel is completely insecure.
For example, CSS protection for DVDs.</li>

## Security Guarantees\*

<pba-flex center>

- Data confidentiality<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragm ent-index="0" -->
- Data authenticity<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragm ent-index="1" -->
- Data integrity<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragm ent-index="2" -->
- Non-repudiation<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragm ent-index="3" -->
- Data availability<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragm ent-index="4" -->
- Data verifiability<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragm ent-index="5" -->
- ...<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragm ent-index="6" -->
  </pba-flex>

<aside class="notes"><p>Cryptography is one of the (most important) tools we have to build tools that are <em>guaranteed</em> to work correctly.
This is regardless of who (human, machine, or otherwise) is using them and their intentions (good or bad).</p>
<p>Why an asterisk?
There generally are no perfect &amp; absolute guarantees here, but for most practical purposes the bounds on where these fail are good enough to serve our needs as engineers and users.
Do note the assumptions and monitor their validity over time (like quantum tech).</p>
</aside></script></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Data Confidentiality

A party may gain access to information<br/>if and only if they know some secret (a key).

<br/>

Confidentiality ensures that a third party cannot read my confidential data.

<aside class="notes"><p>The ability to decrypt some data and reveal its underlying information directly implies knowledge of some secret, potentially unknown to the originator of the information.
Supplying the original information (aka plain text message) can be used in a &quot;challenge game&quot; mechanism as one means of proving knowledge of the secret without compromising it.</p>
<p>Mention use of the term &quot;plaintext&quot;.</p>
<p>Allegory: A private document stored on server where sysadmin has <em>access</em> can be subpoenaed, violating assumed Attorney-Client Privilege on the document.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
<!-- This slide should potentially be pushed into the lecture on encryption. I can see it in either spot. Alternately, could be cut entirely, as encrypted communication is not an emphasized topic. -->

## Confidentiality in Communication Channels

Suppose Alice and Bob are sending confidential messages back and forth. There are some subtypes of confidentiality here:

- **Forward Secrecy**: Even if an adversary temporarily learns Alice's secret, it cannot read future messages after some point.
- **Backwards Secrecy**: Even if an adversary temporarily learns Alice's secret, it cannot read past messages beyond some previous point.
</script></section></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Data Authenticity

Users can have the **credible** expectation that the stated origin of a message is authentic.

<br/>

Authenticity ensures that a third party cannot pretend I created some data.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragm ent-index="1" -->

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Digital signatures should be difficult (practically speaking: impossible) to forge.</li>
<li>Digital signatures should verify that the signer knows some secret, without revealing the secret itself.</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Data Integrity

If data is tampered with, it is detectable. In other words, it possible to check if the current state of some data is the consistent with when it was created.

<br/>

Integrity ensures that if data I create is corrupted, it can be detected.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragm ent-index="1" --></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Physical Signatures

Physical signatures provide weak authenticity guarantees<br/>(i.e. they are quite easy to forge), and no integrity guarantees.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## An Ideal Signature

<img style="width: 900px;" src="./img/Data-Integrity.png" />

<aside class="notes"><p>For example, if you change the year on your university diploma, the dean&#39;s signature is still valid.
Digital signatures provide a guarantee that the signed information has not been tampered with.</p>
</aside></script></section></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Non-repudiation

The sender of a message cannot deny that they sent it.

<br/>

Non-repudiation ensures if Bob sends me some data, I can prove to a third party that they sent it.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragm ent-index="1" -->
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Data availability

Not always considered a cryptographic guarantee, but in many contexts we would like that data is available to people when they want to access it.

<aside class="notes"><p>Cryptography alone cannot make strong guarantees that data is available to people when they want to access it.</p>
<p>There are many schemes to get around this, and this topic will come up later in the course.
We will touch on erasure coding, which makes data availability more efficient.</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Data Verifiability

In some contexts we want to show that (possibly sensitive) data satisfies certain properties.

<aside class="notes"><p>Proving without showing --&gt; we will see that zero-knowledge proofs will allow us to show that a data satisfies certain properties. For example, that I know the key that corresponds to the ciphertext data that I have sent you. Or that the data I have sent you is indeed the correct result of a computation.</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## One-Way Functions

One-way functions form the basis of cryptographic primitives. A function $f$ is one way if:

- it is reasonably fast to compute<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragm ent-index="1" -->
- it is very, very slow to undo<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragm ent-index="2" -->

<aside class="notes"><p>There are a lot of assumptions about why these functions are hard to invert, but we cannot rigorously prove it.
We often express inversion problems in terms of mathematical games or oracles.</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Hash Functions

**Motivation:** We often want a succinct, yet unique representation of some (potentially large) data.

</br>

A fingerprint, which is much smaller than a person, yet uniquely identifies an individual.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragm ent-index="1" -->

<aside class="notes"><p>The following slides serve as an intro.
Many terms may be glossed over, and covered in detail later.
There are lessons later in this module dedicated to hashes and hash-based data structures.</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Hash Function Applications

Hashes can be useful for many applications:

<pba-flex center>

- Representation of larger data object<br/>(history, commitment, file)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragm ent-index="0" -->
- Keys in a database<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragm ent-index="1" -->
- Digital signatures<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragm ent-index="2" -->
- Key derivation<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragm ent-index="3" -->
- Pseudorandom functions<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragm ent-index="4" -->

</pba-flex>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Hash Function Properties

- Accept unbounded size input <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->
- Map to a bounded output <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Be fast to compute <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Resist pre-image attacks:<br />Given an output, it is hard to compute a pre-image <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- Second pre-image resistance: <br />Given an input (and its hashed output), it is hard to compute another input with the same hash<br /><!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
- Resist collisions:<br />It is hard to compute two inputs that have the same hash<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->

<aside class="notes"><ol>
<li>one way meaning for a given output difficult to get the input</li>
<li>attacker has the value 5 and from that can find a preimage that hashes to 5 (5 just an example value)</li>
<li>attacker has input and output and cant find a another input which maps to the output</li>
<li>More generally the attacker has the entire input space and cant find two inputs which hash to the same value</li>
</ol>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Hash Function API

A hash function should:

- Accept an unbounded input size (`[u8]` byte array)
- Return a fixed-length output (here, a 32 byte array).

```rust
fn hash(s: &[u8]) -> [u8; 32];
```
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Example

**Short input (5 bytes):**

```text
hash('hello') =
 0x1c8aff950685c2ed4bc3174f3472287b56d9517b9c948127319a09a7a36deac8
```

**Large input (1.2 MB):**

```text
hash(Harry_Potter_series_as_string) u
 0xc4d194054f03dc7155ccb080f1e6d8519d9d6a83e916960de973c93231aca8f4
```
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Input Sensitivity

Changing even 1 bit of a hash function _completely_ scrambles the output.

```text
hash('hello') =
 0x1c8aff950685c2ed4bc3174f3472287b56d9517b9c948127319a09a7a36deac8

```text
hash('hellp') =

## Speed

- Some hash functions are designed to be slow. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->
- Does anyone know why someone would want a hash function to be slow? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- These have applications like password hashing, which would slow down brute-force attackers. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- For our purposes, we generally want them to be fast. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

## Non-Cryptographic Hash Functions

Non-cryptographic hash functions provide weaker<br />guarantees in exchange for performance.

They are OK to use when you know that the input is not malicious.

**If in doubt, use a cryptographic hash function.**
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## One Way

Given a hash, it should be difficult to find an input value (pre-image)<br />that would produce the given hash.

That is, given `H(x)`, it should be difficult to find `x`.

<aside class="notes"><p>We sometimes add random bytes to pre-images to prevent guesses based on context (e.g., if you are hashing &quot;rock, paper, scissors&quot;, then finding a pre-image is trivial without some added randomness.)</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Second Pre-Image Attacks

Given a hash and a pre-image, it should be difficult to find _another_<br />pre-image that would produce the same hash.

Given `H(x)`, it should be difficult to find any `x'`

such that `H(x) == H(x')`.

<aside class="notes"><p>Since most signature schemes perform some internal hashing, this second pre-image would also pass signature verification.</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Collision Resistance

It should be difficult for someone to find two messages that<br />hash to the same value.

It should be difficult to find an `x` and `y`

such that `H(x) == H(y)`.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Collision Resistance

**Difference from second pre-image attack:**

In a second pre-image attack, the attacker only controls one input.

In a collision, the attacker controls both inputs.

<aside class="notes"><p>Attacker has intention to impersonate the signer with the other. Generally speaking, even finding a
single hash collision often results in the hash function being considered unsafe.</p>

## Birthday Attack

Thus, with a birthday attack, it is possible to find a collision of a hash function in $\sqrt {2^{n}}=2^{^{\frac{n}{2}}}$, with $\cdot 2^{^{\frac{n}{2}}}$ being the classical preimage resistance security.

So, hash function security is only half of the bit space.

## Partial Resistance

It should be difficult for someone to partially (for a substring of the hash output) find a collision or "second" pre-image.

- Bitcoin PoW is a partial pre-image attack. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->
- Can anyone explain how? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

<aside class="notes"><p>This is a technique used to trick users into thinking they are interacting with a trusted entity (like a account or piece of data) when they are actually interacting with a malicious actor.

## Hash Function Selection

<pba-flex center>

When users (i.e. attackers) have control of the input, cryptographic hash functions must be used.

When input is not controllable (e.g. a system-assigned index), a non-cryptographic hash function can be used and is faster.

<aside class="notes"><p>Only safe when the users cannot select the pre-image, e.g. a system-assigned index.</p>

# Applications
</script></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Cryptographic Guarantees

Let's see which cryptographic properties apply to hashes.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Confidentiality

- Sending or publicly posting a hash of some data $D$ keeps $D$ confidential, as only those who already knew $D$ recognize $H(D)$ as representing $D$.
- Both cryptographic and non-cryptographic hashes work for this, _only if the input space is large enough_.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Confidentiality Bad Example

Imagine playing rock, paper, scissors by posting hashes and then revealing. However, if the message is either "rock", "paper", or "scissors", the output will always be either:

```text
hash('rock') = 0x10977e4d68108d418408bc9310b60fc6d0a750c63ccef42cfb0ead23ab73d102
hash('paper') = 0xea923ca2cdda6b54f4fb2bf6a063e5a59a6369ca4c4ae2c4ce02a147b3036a21
hash('scissors') = 0x389a2d4e358d901bfdf22245f32b4b0a401cc16a4b92155a2ee5da98273dad9a
```

The other player doesn't need to undo the hash function to know what you played!

<aside class="notes"><p>Question:
How can we fix this issue?</p>
<p>The data space has to be <em>sufficiently large</em>.
Adding some randomness to input of the hash fixes this. Add x bits of randomness to make it x bits of security on that hash.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Authenticity

Anyone can make a hash, so hashes provide no authenticity guarantees.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Integrity

A hash changes if the data changes, so it does provide integrity.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Non-Repudiation

Hashes on their own cannot provide authenticity, and as such cannot provide non-repudiation.

However, if used in another cryptographic primitive that _does_ provide non-repudiation, $H(D)$ provides the same non-repudation as $D$ itself.

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>The hash alone doesnt give one the ability to authenticate or identify the originator of the data because anyone with access to the data can produce the same hash.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is key in digital signatures. However, it&#39;s important to realize that if $D$ is kept secret, $H(D)$ is basically meaningless.</p>
</aside></script></section></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Content-Derived Indexing

Hash functions can be used to generate deterministic<br />and unique lookup keys for databases.

<aside class="notes"><p>Given some fixed property, like an ID and other metadata the user knows beforehand, they can always find the database entry with all of the content they are looking for.</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Data Integrity Checks

Members of a peer-to-peer network may host and share<br />file chunks rather than large files.

In [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent), each file chunk is hash identified so peers can<br /> _request and verify_ the chunk is a member of the larger,<br /> _content addressed_ file.

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li><p>Content addressed file is when a file is identified based on the content of the file.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The hash of the large file can also serve as a signal to the protocol that transmission is complete.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Account Abstractions

Public keys can be used to authorize actions by signing of instructions.

The properties of hash functions allow other kinds of representations.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Public Key Representation

Because hashes serve as unique representations of other data,<br />that other data could include public keys.<br />
A system can map a plurality of key sizes to a fixed length<br />(e.g. for use as a database key).

For example, the ECDSA public key is 33 bytes:

```text
Public key (hex):
  0x02d82cdc83a966aaabf660c4496021918466e61455d2bc403c34bde8148b227d7a

Hash of pub key:
  0x8fea32b38ed87b4739378aa48f73ea5d0333b973ee72c5cb7578b143f82cf7e9
                                                                    ^^
```
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Commitment Schemes

It is often useful to commit to some information<br /> without storing or revealing it:

- A prediction market would want to reveal predictions only after the confirming/refuting event occurred.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->
- Users of a system may want to discuss proposals without storing the proposal on the system.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

## Data Identifiers

Sometimes people want to store information in one place and reference it in another. For reference, they need some "fingerprint" or digest.

As an example, they may vote on executing some privileged instructions within the system.

The hash of the information can succinctly represent the information and commit its creator to not altering it.

## Pointer-Based Linked Lists

Pointer-based linked lists are a foundation of programming.

But pointers are independent from the data they reference,<br />so the data can be modified while maintaining the list.

That is, pointer-based linked lists are not tamper evident.

## Symmetric Cryptography

<pba-flex center>

- Symmetric cryptography assumes all parties begin with some shared secret information.

## Digital Signatures

**Signing function**: a function which operates on some<br/>_message data_ and some _secret_ to yield a _signature_.

A **signature** _proves_ that the signer had knowledge of the secret,<br/>without revealing the secret itself.

The signature cannot be used to create other signatures, and is unique to the message.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragm ent-index="1" -->

<aside class="notes"><p>A <strong>signing function</strong> is a pure function which operates on some <em>message data</em> (which may or may not be small, depending on the function) and some <em>secret</em> (a small piece of information known only to the operator).
The result of this function is a small piece of data called a <em>signature</em>.</p>
<p>Pure means that it has no side effects.</p>
<p>It has a special property: it proves (beyond reasonable doubt) that the signer (i.e. operator of the signing function) had knowledge of the secret and utilized this knowledge with the specific <em>message</em> data, yet it does not reveal the secret itself, nor can knowledge of the signature be used to create other signatures (e.g. for alternative message data).</p>

## Non-repudiation for Cryptographic Signatures

There is cryptographic proof that the secret was known to the producer of the signature.

The signer cannot claim that the signature was forged, unless they can defend a claim that the secret was compromised prior to signing.<br/><!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragm ent-index="1" -->

## Signing Hashed Messages

As mentioned in the introduction,<br />it's often more practical to sign the hash of a message.

Schnorr & BLS multi-signatures avoid complicating verifier logic,<br/>but introduce user experience costs such as:

- DKG protocols<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->
- Reduced key derivation ability<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Verification speed<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Proof of possession verification.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Ring Signatures

- Ring signatures prove the signer lies within some "anonymity set" of signing keys, but hide which key actually signed.
  <img style="height: 300px" src="./img/Ring-signature.png" /><!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Ring signatures come in many sizes, with many ways of presenting their anonymity sets.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Anonymous blockchain transactions typically employ ring signatures (Monero, ZCash).<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>ZCash uses a ring signature based upon Groth16 zkSNARKs which makes the entire chain history be the anonymity set.</li>
<li>Monero uses ring signatures with smaller signer sets.</li>
<li>Ring signatures trade some <em>non-repudation</em> for <em>privacy</em>.</li>

## Practical Considerations

**Symmetric cryptography** is much faster, but requires more setup (key establishment) and trust (someone else knows the secret).

**Asymmetric cryptography** is slow, but typically preserves specific algebraic relationships, which then permit more diverse if fragile protocols.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Hybrid Cryptography

Hybrid cryptography composes new mechanisms from different cryptographic primitives.

For example:

- Symmetric encryption can provide speed, and often confidentiality,<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragm ent-index="1" -->
- Hash functions can reduce the size of data while preserving identity,<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragm ent-index="2" -->
- Asymmetric cryptography can dictate relations among the participants.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragm ent-index="3" -->
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Certifications

Certifications are used to make attestations about public key relationships.

Typically in the form of a _signature_ on:

- One or more cryptographically strong identifiers (e.g. public keys, hashes).
- Information about its ownership, its use and any other properties that the signer is capable of attesting/authorizing/witnessing.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragm ent-index="1" -->
- "(Meta-)information" about this information itself, such as how long it is valid for and external considerations which would invalidate it.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragm ent-index="1" -->

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Real application is the hierarchy of SSL certs.<ul>
<li>Root keys -&gt; State level entities -&gt; Smaller entities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Web of Trust &amp; GPG cross-signing</li>
<li>In the case of signature-based certificates, as long as you have the signature, data, and originating public key, you can trust a certificate no matter where it came from. It could be posted on a public message board, sent to you privately, or etched into stone.</li>
</ul>

## Verifiable Random Functions<br/>(VRFs)

<widget-center>

- Used to obtain <ins>private randomness</ins>, that is <ins>publicly verifiable</ins>

- A variation on a signature scheme:
  - still have private/public key pairs, input as message
  - in addition to signature, we get an output
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## VRF Interface

- `eval(sk,input) -> output`

- `sign(sk, input) -> signature`

- `verify(pk, input, signature) -> option output`

<aside class="notes"><p>The output of verification being an option represents the possibility of an invalid signature</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## VRF Output properties

- Output is a deterministic function of _key_ and _input_
  - i.e. eval should be deterministic
- It should be pseudo-random
- But until the VRF proof is revealed, only the holder<br/>of the secret key knows the output
- Revealing output does not leak secret key
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## VRF Usage

- Choose input after key, then the key holder cannot influence the output
- The output then is effectively a random number known only to the key holder
- But they can later reveal it, by publishing the VRF proof (signature)

<aside class="notes"><p>The signature proves that this is the output associated to their input and public key.</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## VRF Example

- Playing a card game in a distributed and trustless way
- For player A to draw a card, the players agree on a new random number x
- A's card is determined by `eval(sk_A,x) mod 52`
- To play the card, A publishes the VRF proof (signature)
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## VRF Example

_Lottery_

- Lottery organizer generate $pk$,$sk$ for VRF;
- Each participants choose their own tickets $t_i$;

## VRF Example

_Lottery_

- Lottery organizer computes `eval(sk,$t_i$)-> $y_i$` for each participants;
- $y_i$ determines wining or not;
- `sign(sk, $t_i$) -> $\sigma_i$` published for verification.

## Recall Signature Interface

- `sign(sk, msg) -> signature;`

- `verify(pk, msg, signature) -> bool;`
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## BLS-based VRF

- `sign(sk,input) `: run `BLS.sign(sk, input)->signature`, return `signature`

- `eval(sk,input)`： return `Hash(signature)`

- `verify(pk,input,signature)`: `BLS.verify(pk, input, signature)?=1`, if holds, output `Hash(signature)`
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## VRF Extensions

- Threshold VRFs / Common coin

  - Generate the same random number if $t$ out of $n$ people participate

- RingVRFs

  - The VRF output could be from any one of a group of public keys.

<aside class="notes"><p>Common coins were used in consensus before blockchains were a thing.
Dfinity based their consensus on this.
But this needs a DKG, and it&#39;s unclear if a decentralized protocol can do those easily.
A participant in a RingVRF could still only reveal <em>one</em> random number.</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Threshold VRFs

- Also called Distributed VRFs;
- Each of the $n$ users get their public/secret key $(pk_i,sk_i)$;
- $t$ participants generate `output_i`, `signature_i` using their key on the same `input`;
- Combine $t$ `output_i`, `signature_i` to get `output`, `signature`.

## Ring Signature and Ring VRFs

- Ring Signature: Sign on behalf of a group people without revealing the true identity of the signer;

## Erasure Coding

_Magical data expansion_

- A type of Error Correction Code </br>Detect and correct errors occur in data transmission without the need for retransmission

- Turn data into pieces (with some redundancy) so it can be reconstructed even if some pieces are missing

- A message of $k$ symbols is turned into a coded message of $n$ symbols and can be recovered from any $k$ of these $n$ symbols
</script></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Erasure Coding Intuition

Erasure coding relies on both parties sharing an understanding of what possible messages are valid. This lets mistakes be noticed and corrected.

Imagine you are receiving a message, and you know ahead of time that the only two possible messages you would receive are `file` and `ruin`.

<aside class="notes"><p>This concept of a subset of messages being valid is super common in real life, and occurs all over the place.
At a restaurant, when they ask you if you want soup or salad, even if you mumble they will probably understand you.</p>

## Erasure Coding Intuition

How would you classify each of the following words?

<span style="color: red;">file pile pale tale tall</span> <span style="color: purple;">rule</span> <span style="color: blue;"> tail rail rain ruin</span>

You can classify them based on how close they are to a valid input. This also means we can find the errors in these messages.

<aside class="notes"><p>There is no perfect way to separate these, but one very reasonable one is to do it based on the edit distance of the received word with any valid messsage you could receive.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Erasure Coding Intuition

Now, you are receiving messages that could be `msg1` or `msg2`. Can you apply the same technique? Is it as easy to separate received messages?

What if you receive `msg3`?

<aside class="notes"><p>If the messages are not far apart, it is impossible to distinguish in many cases. There is not enough &quot;distance&quot; between the two possibilities.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Erasure Coding Intuition

With erasure coding, we extend each message magically so they are different enough. The sender and receiver know the same encoding procedure. These extensions will be very different, even if the messages are similar.

`msg1`<span style="color: red;">`jdf`</span> and `msg2`<span style="color: red;">`ajk`</span>

<aside class="notes"><p>It is actually always possible to make the extra magic only appended to the message. This is called a <em>systematic encoding</em>.</p>
<p>For those curious about how the &quot;magic&quot; works:</p>
<p>The magic here is polynomials, and the fact that a polynomial of degree $n$ is completely determined by $n+1$ points. There are many good explanations online.</p>
