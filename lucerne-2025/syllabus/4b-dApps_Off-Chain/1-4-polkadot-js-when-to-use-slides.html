## When Might You Want to Use Polkadot-JS?
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Historical Metadata Queries

- Essential for analyzing past chain state
- Comprehensive support for all historical runtime versions
- Crucial for block explorers and data analysis tools

<aside class="notes"><p>One of the standout features of Polkadot-JS is its comprehensive support for historical metadata. This makes it the tool of choice for applications that need to analyze or display data from any point in the chain&#39;s history.</p>
<p>Block explorers, data analysis tools, and historical auditing applications all benefit from this capability. No other tool currently provides the same level of historical compatibility, making Polkadot-JS irreplaceable for these use cases.</p>
<p>As chains evolve and undergo runtime upgrades, the structure of their data and the methods for interacting with them change. Polkadot-JS maintains backward compatibility with all these changes, allowing developers to decode and interpret data from any block height.</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### As a Reference or Utility

- Useful for learning Substrate interactions before implementing custom solutions
- Provides working examples of common blockchain operations
- Source code serves as documentation for Substrate interaction patterns

<aside class="notes"><p>Even when building custom solutions, Polkadot-JS serves as an invaluable reference. Its source code effectively documents how to interact with Substrate chains at a low level, making it easier to understand the underlying protocols and data structures. That being said, there are definitely exceptions (rpc interface, extension interface, etc).</p>
<p>Many developers start by prototyping their applications with Polkadot-JS before implementing more specialized solutions. This approach allows them to validate their concepts quickly before investing in custom development.</p>
<p>The various utilities provided by Polkadot-JS, particularly in the @polkadot/util and @polkadot/util-crypto packages, remain useful even when building applications that don&#39;t use the full API. These well-tested utilities save developers from having to reimplement common cryptographic and formatting functions.</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Legacy System Maintenance

- Many existing tools still rely on Polkadot-JS
- Understanding the library is crucial for maintaining these systems
- Required for debugging issues in Polkadot-JS-dependent applications

<aside class="notes"><p>A significant portion of the Polkadot ecosystem was built with Polkadot-JS, and these systems will continue to require maintenance for years to come. Understanding Polkadot-JS is essential for developers tasked with maintaining or updating these existing applications.</p>
<p>When issues arise in these systems, debugging often requires a deep knowledge of how Polkadot-JS interacts with the blockchain. Without this understanding, diagnosing and fixing problems becomes significantly more challenging.</p>
<p>Even as new applications increasingly adopt newer tools, the legacy of Polkadot-JS will persist in the ecosystem for the foreseeable future, ensuring that expertise in this library remains valuable.</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### For Comprehensive Development UIs

- Polkadot.js Apps remains the most generalized UI for chain interaction
- Provides a sandbox for testing chain functionality
- Polkadot.js Extension for a airgapped developer first extension

<aside class="notes"><p>The Polkadot.js Apps interface remains one of the most comprehensive UIs for interacting with Substrate-based chains. It provides access to virtually every aspect of chain functionality, from basic transfers to complex governance operations.</p>
<p>This interface serves as an invaluable sandbox for testing and debugging chain functionality. Developers can use it to verify that their on-chain logic works as expected before integrating it into their own applications.</p>
<p>While more specialized and user-friendly interfaces exist for specific chains and use cases, none match the comprehensiveness of Polkadot.js Apps for development and debugging purposes.</p>
