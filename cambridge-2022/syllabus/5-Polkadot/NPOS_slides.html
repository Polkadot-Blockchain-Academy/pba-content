# Nominated Proof of Stake

## Why Proof of Stake Ser?

Why do we use PoS?

<div>

Economic Security üí∏ü§ë

Tokens locked + prone to being slashed.

</div>

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Everything else (finality, parachains, etc.) is built on top of this base layer of economic security.

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
</script></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What is NPoS: Assumptions

Assumptions:

- **Validators**: those who wish to author blocks.
- **Nominators/Delegators**: Those who wish to support wanna-be authors.

- Validation and nomination intentions can change, therefore we need **periodic elections** to
  always choose the best validators + hold them slashable.
- Every election period is called an **_Era_**, e.g. 24hrs in Polkadot.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### What is NPoS: Re-inventing the Wheel

**Solo-POS**

Authority-wanna-bees aka. validators bring their own stake. No further participation. Top validators
are elected.

Problems?

<aside class="notes"><p>Low amount of stake that we can capture, impossible for those who don&#39;t want to run the hardware to join.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### What is NPoS: Re-inventing the Wheel

**Single-Delegation-POS**

Anyone can dilute themselves in any given validators. Top validator based on total stake are
elected.

Problems?

<aside class="notes"><p>Better, but funds might be delegated to non-winners, which get wasted.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### What is NPoS: Re-inventing the Wheel

**Multi-Delegation-POS**

Your stake is divided $\frac{1}{N}$ among $N$ validators.

Problems?

<aside class="notes"><p>Same issue as before.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### What is NPoS: Re-inventing the Wheel

**Nominated Proof of Stake**

You name up to `N` nominees, an _arbitrary algorithm_, computed either onchain or offchain, decides
the **winners** and **how to distribute the stake among them**.

- ‚úÖ Can optimize other criteria other than "who had more approval votes".
- ‚úÖ Has a much higher chance to make sure staked tokens won't get wasted.

> NPoS is **approval-based, multi-winner election**.

### NPoS Protocol Overview

The current NPoS protocol revolves around an **election round**, which is itself made up of 4
episodes.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### NPoS Protocol Overview

1. Validator + Nominator **Snapshot**

- Allows us to index stakers, not AccountIds.
- Allows us to not need to "freeze" the staking system.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### NPoS Protocol Overview

2. Signed Phase

Any signed account can come up with a **NPoS solution** based on that snapshot.

Deposits, rewards, slash, other game-theoretic tools incorporated to make to secure.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### NPoS Protocol Overview

3. Unsigned Phase

As the first backup, any validator can also submit a solution as a part of their block authoring.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### NPoS Protocol Overview

4. Fallbacks

If all of the above fails, the chain won't rotate validators and the governance can either:

- dictate the next validator set
- trigger an onchain election (limited in what it can do)
</script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Why NPoS

1. Polkadot validators are the source of truth for the state transition of both the relay chain and all of the parachains + bridges.
1. Polkadot validator are assigned to parachains as backing group, and swapped over time.
1. Polkadot validators all author the same number of blocks.

> What properties to we want a validator set have for the above requirements?

<aside class="notes"><p>Point 2 is not to imply that the polkadot validator set&#39;s security is partitioned among parachains,
security comes from approval voters.

</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Why NPoS: Election Score

```rust
pub struct ElectionScore {
  /// The minimal winner, in terms of total backing stake.
  ///
  /// This parameter should be maximized.
  pub minimal_stake: u128,
  /// The sum of the total backing of all winners.
  ///
  /// This parameter should maximized
  pub sum_stake: u128,
  /// The sum squared of the total backing of all winners, aka. the variance.
  ///
  /// Ths parameter should be minimized.
  pub sum_stake_squared: u128,
}
```
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Why NPoS: Election Score

> NPoS allows us to incentivize the formation of a validator set that optimized the aforementioned `ElectionScore`.

## NPoS Protocol: Proportional Representation

Not strictly checked at the moment, but a core component in w3f's initial design to make NPoS what
it is now.

> Among all nominators $N$, if a minority $N^‚Ä≤$ has at least $t$ commonly trusted candidates, to whom it could "afford‚Äù to provide with an average support of at least $\frac{1}{n_{val}}$ $\sum_{n‚ààN} stake_n$, then this minority has a justified claim to be represented in $V$ by at least $t$ candidates.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### NPoS Protocol: Proportional Representation

We initially chose an algorithm called `Sequential Phragmen`, which fulfills proportional justified
representation (**PJR**).

We have the code to do a PJR check, but it is not feasible to do onchain, and hasn't been a high
priority for us either.
</script></section></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## NPoS Future

- First, repay any technical debt, make everything ready for any further scaling.
- Infra for multi-block election
  - Onchain
  - Offchain
- Staking/Election parachain
- More (tax) friendly/configurable reward payout.
