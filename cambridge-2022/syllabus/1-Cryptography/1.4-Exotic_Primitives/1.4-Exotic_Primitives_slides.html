# Verifiable Random Functions<br>(VRFs)
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Verifiable Random Functions<br>(VRFs)

<widget-center>

- Used to obtain <ins>private randomness</ins>, that is <ins>publicly verifiable</ins>

- A variation on a signature scheme:
  - still have private/public key pairs, input as message
  - in addition to signature, we get an output
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## VRF Interface

- `sign(sk, input) -> signature`

- `verify(pk, signature) -> option output`

- `eval(sk,input) -> output`
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## VRF Output properties

- Output is a deterministic function of _key_ and _input_
  - i.e. eval should be deterministic
- It should be pseudo-random
- But until the VRF is revealed, only the holder of the secret key knows the output
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## VRF Usage

- Choose input after key, then the key holder cannot influence the output
- The output then is effectively a random number known only to the key holder
- But they can later reveal it, by publishing the VRF proof (signature)

<aside class="notes"><p>The signature proves that this is the output associated to their input and public key.</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## VRF Example

- Playing a card game in a distributed and trustless way
- For player A to draw a card, the players agree on a new random number x
- A's card is determined by
  `eval(sk_A,x) mod 52`
- To play the card, A publishes the signature
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## VRF Extensions

- Threshold VRFs / Common coin

  - generate the same random number if $t$ out of $n$ people participate

- RingVRFs
  - the VRF output could be from any one of a group of public keys.

<aside class="notes"><p>Common coins were used in consensus before blockchains were a thing.
Dfinity based their consensus on this.
But this needs a DKG, and it&#39;s unclear if a decentralized protocol can do those easily.</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# Erasure Coding
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Erasure Coding

- Turn data into pieces (with some redundancy) so it can be reconstructed even if some pieces are missing.

- A message of $k$ symbols is turned into a coded message of $n$ symbols and can be recovered from any $k$ of these $n$ symbols
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Erasure Coding Classical use

- Used for noisy channels
- If a few bits of the coded data are randomly flipped, we can still recover the original data
- Typically $n$ is not much bigger than $k$
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Use in Decentralized Systems

- We have data we want to keep publicly available

  - but not have everyone store
  - but we don't trust everyone who is storing pieces

- Typically we use $n$ much bigger than $k$
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# ZK Proofs
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## ZK Proofs

How do we do private operations on a public blockchain and have everyone know that they were done correctly?

<aside class="notes"><p>(we are working on substrate support for these and will use them for protocols)</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What is a ZK Proof?

- A prover wants to convince a verifier that something is true without revealing why it is true.

- They can be interactive protocols, but mostly we'll be dealing with the non-interactive variety.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What can we show?

- NP relation: `function(statement, witness) -> bool`

- Prover knows a witness for a statement:

  - they want to show that they know it (_a proof of knowledge_)

  - ... without revealing anything about the witness (_ZK_)
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## ZK Proof Interface

- NP relation: `function(statement, witness) -> bool`

* `prove(statement, witness) -> proof`

* `verify(statement, proof) -> bool`
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
_Example:_ Schnorr signatures are ZK Proofs

- They show that the prover knows the private key (the discrete log of the public key) without revealing anything about it.
- The statement is the public key and the witness the private key.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
- **Proof of knowledge** - if you can compute correct proofs of a statement, you should be able to compute a witness for it.

- **Zero knowledge** - the proof reveals nothing about the witness that was not revealed by the statement itself.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What can we show?

- NP relation: `function(statement, witness) -> bool`

  - they want to show that they know it (_a proof of knowledge_)

  - ... without revealing anything about the witness (_ZK_)

- with a small proof even if the witness is large (_succinctness_)
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
- There are many schemes to produce succinct ZK proofs of knowledge (_ZK-SNARKs_) for every NP relation.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## ZK Proof Scaling

A small amount of data, a ZK proof, and execution time can be used to show properties of a much larger dataset which the verifier doesn't need to know.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Scaling via ZK Proofs in Blockchain

- Large amount of data - a blockchain
- Verifier is e.g. an app on a mobile phone

<aside class="notes"><p>e.g. Mina do a blockchain with a constant size proof (of correctness of execution and consensus) using recursive SNARKs.</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Scaling via ZK Proofs in Blockchain

- The verifier is a blockchain, with very expensive data and computation costs

- Layer 2s using ZK rollups

<aside class="notes"><p>Of which Ethereum has many, ZKsync, ZKEVM etc.
Polkadot already scales better!</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Privacy

A user has private data, but we can show publicly that this private data is correctly used.

Example: private cryptocurrency

- Keep amounts secret
  - but show they are positive!
- Keep who pays who secret

<aside class="notes"><p>You can do some of keeping amounts secret without ZK-SNARKs, but the positive part is difficult.
To do everything well, ZK-SNARKs are needed in e.g. ZCash and its many derivatives e.g. Manta.</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Practical Considerations

- Very powerful primitive

- Useful for both scaling and privacy

- One can design many protocols with ZK Proofs that wouldn't otherwise be possible
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Downside

- Slow prover time for general computation
- To be fast, need to hand optimize
- Very weird computation model: Non-deterministic arithmetic circuits
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Downsides Conclusion?

- So if you want to use this for a component, expect a team of skilled people to work for at least a year on it...
- But if you are watching this 5 years later, people have built tools to make it less painful.
