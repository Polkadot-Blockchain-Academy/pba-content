## What is Game Theory?

> Game theory is the study of mathematical models of conflict and cooperation between intelligent and rational decision makers.
> Rational means that each individual’s decision-making behavior is consistent with the maximization of subjective expected utility.
> Intelligent means that each individual understands everything about the structure of the situation, including the fact that others are intelligent rational decision makers.

_Roger Myerson, 1986_

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>This sets the stage for this lecture</li>
<li>Some important keywords:<ul>
<li>conflict and cooperation: Depending on the situation, there might be cooperation or conflict between the players, sometimes both.</li>
<li>Rationality is a big assumption here, mainly to maximize utility.</li>
<li>Often (as we saw in 2.1) this solely means to maximize monetary payouts, but the utility functions could depend on more factors.</li>
<li>We (generally) assume that all players know about the rules of the game and that they have enough processing power to compute everything necessary.</li>
</ul>

## Game Theory in Web3

In the context of blockchains, game theoretic reasoning is used for:

- **Tokenomics**: The specific design of how people interact in the ecosystem.
- **Consensus**: Do the nodes in the network have the right incentives to follow the consensus protocol?

<aside class="notes"><p>You wont recognize these terms just yet, but next module we will dive deep into them.
Keep them in mind as we move forward: this is <em>why</em> we study Economics in this academy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Blockchain economics/tokenomics is all about understanding how people will act in situations where information and rules are transparent.</li>
<li>We’ll cover the basics of game theory today, but let’s look through some of the core moments in this field so that you can go as deep as you’d like.</li>

## History of Game Theory

- Early “game theoretic” research early 19th century, still relevant.
- The systematic study of games started in the 20th century.
- Modern game theory is used in economics, biology, sociology, political science, psychology, among others.

In economics, game theory is used to analyze many different strategic situations like auctions, industrial economics, and business administration.

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<aside class="notes"><p><strong>History of Game Theory</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Early “game theoretic” research that still resonates today goes way back into the early 19th century:</p>
<ul>
<li>1838, Antoine Augustin Cournot: Cournot competition, uses an early, simplified version of Nash equilibrium.</li>
<li>1881: Francis Edgeworth: trade with two consumers and two goods.</li>
<li>1913, Ernst Zermelo: chess, first formal application of backward induction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The systematic study of games started in the 40/50s of the 20th century:</p>
<ul>
<li>1944: John von Neumann and Oscar Morgenstern publish <em>Theory of Games and Economic Behavior</em>.</li>

## Game theory is _abstract_

Game theoretic models aim to get at the essence of a given strategic problem.
This often requires that many facets of the problem are assumed away.

- Pro: _Abstraction_ makes the problem amenable to analysis and helps to identify the key incentives at work.
- Con: A certain lack of realism.
- In any case: Modeling a strategic situation always entails a tradeoff between tractability and realism.

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Need to explain what we mean by lack of realism:<ul>
<li>Often people have more choices than we model.</li>
<li>Often people take other things into consideration when making choices than the model allows.</li>
<li>Often people know more/less than we assume.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How to resolve the tradeoff between tractability and realism is often subjective and depends on the taste of the modeler.</li>

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Definition: (Economic) Game

A game is a strategic interaction between several players, where _common knowledge_ among all the players of the game includes:

1. all the possible _actions_ of the players
1. all the possible _outcomes_
1. how each combination of actions affects the outcome
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Definition: Common Knowledge

An event $X$ is common knowledge if (1) everyone knows $X$, (2) everyone knows that everyone knows $X$, (3) everyone knows that everyone knows that everyone knows $X$, and so on ad infinitum.

# Quiz

### Three firms want to hire an engineer...

<widget-columns>
<widget-column>

- The engineer brings added value to each firm of $300,000$ USD per year.
- The payoff of the firm is $300,000$ USD minus the salary.
- The payoff to the engineer is salary minus cost of working, which is known to everyone.
- All firms make a salary offer at the same time.

</widget-column>

### Quiz Questions:

</center>

1. Is this game static or dynamic?
   What would need to change in the description of the game such that it would fall in the other category?
1. Is this game of complete or incomplete information?
   What would need to change in the description of the game such that it would fall in the other category?

</widget-column>
</widget-columns>

<aside class="notes"><ol>
<li>The game is static.
For it to be dynamic, firms would need to make offers sequentially, <em>knowing what the firms before had offered</em>.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>This lecture focuses on static games of complete information.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The game is of complete information.
To make information incomplete, we would need to have that the value of hiring the engineer differs between firms and is unknown between firms.
Or that the cost of working for the engineer is not known to the firms.
The point is that we need to have uncertainty over payoffs.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>When we look at auctions in Session 3.3, we will also consider games of incomplete information, both dynamic and static.</li>

In the interrogation they both are offered the following: <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Choosing D is a _dominant strategy_.

<aside class="notes"><p>No matter what Clyde does, it is always the best choice.
So, they end up both defecting, resulting in 4 years each.
It would be in their best interest to cooperate and not to say anything.
This would minimize the total jail time for the two.
However, both Bonnie and Clyde are rational utility maximizers.
So, they end up in a situation where they not only fare worse <em>individually</em> (4 instead of 2) but also <em>jointly</em> (the total jail time is 8 years rather than 4 years).</p>

## Prisoners' Dilemma IRL

**[Nuclear Arms Race](https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/arms-race)**

NATO and Russia prefer no arms race to an arms race.
Yet, having some arms is preferable to having no arms, irrespective whether the other one is armed.

**[OPEC](https://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/)**

Limiting oil supply is in the best interest of all.
However, given the high price that thus results, everyone has an incentive to increase individual oil supply to maximize profits.

- Nash equilibrium _does not_ predict which strategies the players actually take.

Literally _any_ point and time is a Nash equilibrium...
However, most people responded: noon at (the information booth at) Grand Central Terminal.

Basic idea: in case of multiple equilibria, **social norms may help to choose one.**

## Public-Good Game

What is a public good?

- Non-rivalrous: My consumption does not affect yours. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Non-excludable: No-one can be excluded from consumption. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

e.g., Fireworks, Polkadot's Public Good Parachains <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Public-Good Game

- All players have some endowment, e.g., 10 US Dollars.
- Each player $i$ can choose how much to contribute, $c_i$, to the public good.
- The consumption value of the public good is $\alpha (c_1+c_2+c_3)$ with $\alpha < 1$.
  - The value of the public good increases with the amount of contributions.
  - Every player (regardless of the contribution) will consume the public good.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Public-Good Game

The payoffs of the players:

- Each player $i$ contributes an amount $c_i \in [0,10]$.
- The payoff function of each player $i$ is
  $$10 - c_i + \alpha (c_1+c_2+c_3)$$

<hr>

<div>

- How would you interpret $\alpha$ ?
- How would you interpret $3\alpha$?
- What would be the best for the collective?

</div>
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>$\alpha$ is the private marginal benefit of contributing to the public good.</li>
<li>$3\alpha$ is the social marginal benefit (there are three players!).</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Public-Good Optimization

The optimum for the collective maximizes total welfare:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
\begin{gathered}
&3\cdot 10 - (c_1-c_2-c_3) + 3\alpha (c_1-c_2-c_3) \\\\ 
&= \\\\
&30 - (1-3\alpha)(c_1-c_2-c_3)
\end{gathered}

Clearly, if $3\alpha > 1$, then it is socially optimal if everyone contributes, $c_i = 10$.

<aside class="notes"><p>Observe: $3\alpha&gt;1$ means that the marginal social benefit of the joint contributions is higher than the marginal social cost of the contributions.</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Public-Good Optimization

Is the socially optimal behavior an individually optimal strategy here?

No.
We have $\alpha<1$.

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<div>
So, the individual payoff $$10 - c_i + \alpha (c_1+c_2+c_3)$$ is always maximized when not contributing at all.

Observe: Not contributing is a _dominant strategy_.

</div>
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

**Question:** What if $\alpha>1$? $\alpha < 1/3$.

</center>
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>So, if $1/3 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1$, then our public good game really is a prisoner&#39;s dilemma with more than two players: it is socially optimal for everyone to contribute but not contributing is a dominant strategy for everyone.</li>
<li>If $\alpha &gt; 1$, then the individual marginal benefit is always higher than the individual marginal cost, and it becomes a dominant strategy for all players to fully invest in the public good.
Then, there would be no public goods problem...</li>
<li>If $\alpha &lt; 1/3$, there is no public good problem, either.
It is socially and individually optimal not to contribute.</li>

- $\alpha < 1$: you make a loss of $(1-\alpha)$ for every US Dollar invested. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- If you get a grant, then Polkadot covers a large proportion of your costs. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Now that most of your investment gets refunded, you make a benefit $\alpha$ per USD invested. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- So, it is optimal for you to invest (even though no one else does). <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## Tragedy of the Commons

Tragedy of the commons is related to public good provision.

A Common good is:

- **Rivalrous**: My consumption reduces your possibility to consume.
- **Non-excludable**: No one can be excluded from consuming the good.

i.e., a public park, an office coffee machine

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Recall: Public good was <em>non</em>-rivalrous.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Public park: anyone can go; too many people spoil the experience.</li>
<li>Coffee machine in the office: anyone can use it; too many users may cause congestion.</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Public vs. Common good

The main difference to a public good is that in a common good your consumption reduces the value of the good to others.
This is called a _consumption externality_ that you impose on others (and others impose on you.)

The _tragedy of the commons_ is that, because you do not take this externality into account, consumption is higher than would be socially optimal.

## Overfishing

- Fishing gives private benefit but might destroy the broader ecosystem, which has its own value for everyone (due to, e.g., tourism). <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Because individual fishermen do not have to pay for the damage they cause to the broader ecosystem, they will individually fish too much. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Air pollution

- Producing a good yields private profit but reduces air quality for everyone. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Because there is no price attached to air quality, the firms do not have to pay for its reduction and, hence, will produce too much. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## Bitcoin

- Mining gives private benefit in the form of mining rewards but hampers environment for everyone. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Again, because there is no price attached to damaging the environment, the miners do not take this into consideration and, hence, will mine too much. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## But...

- There should be fishing/production/mining! <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  After all there are always benefits to these activities. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- The tragedy of the commons is that the externality is not priced into these activities, driving them to inefficiently high levels. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## Tragedy of Commons Model

There is a resource of size $K$ and two players:

- Each player enjoys consuming $k_i$ but both also enjoy the remaining resource $K-k_1-k_2$.
- Utility of player $1$: $u_1(k_1,k_2) = \ln(k_1)+\ln(K-k_1-k_2).$
- Utility of player $2$: $u_2(k_1,k_2) = \ln(k_2)+\ln(K-k_1-k_2).$

Each player derives utility from consumption, but gets hurt by the consumption of the other player.

## Tragedy of Commons Model

In this game a Nash equilibrium is a vector of consumption choices, $(k_1^*,k_2^*)$, such that $k_1^*$ is optimal given $k_2^*$ and vice versa.

Nash equilibrium solution:

1. Fix consumption of player $2$, $k_2$, and try to characterize the optimal choice of player $1$.
1. Fix the consumption of player $1$, $k_1$, and try to characterize the best response of player $2$.
1. Find $(k_1,k_2)$ such that both players play a best response to each other.

## Tragedy of Commons Model

The socially optimal consumption level is _lower_ than the mutually optimal one...
Why?

Consumption externality: each player inflicts harm on the other player when consuming but does not take this into account for the individually optimal decision.

What about utilities?

## Tragedy of Commons Model

Traditional solutions to the tragedy of the commons:

- Taxes: The government requires both players to pay a tax $\tau\cdot k_i$, where $\tau > 0$ is the tax rate.
  This way, consumption becomes more expensive, leading to a reduction.
- Licenses: The government might charge a fee $F> 0$ to consume in the first place and then redistributes the proceeds again among the affected parties.

## Game 1: Guessing Game

- We divide the classroom into three groups and play a guessing game.
- The budget for this game is: $200.
- The game is simple: The player who guessed closest to the 2/3 of the average guesses wins.
- If multiple people win, the payoff is split equally.
- The game is repeated for ten rounds.
- Three different group sizes: 10, 20 and 30 students.

- We will play a public good game as presented in the lecture.
- Budget for this game: $400
- Groups of 4 over 10 periods.
- The efficiency factor is 1.6 - (that is 4 \* 0.4, which is the social marginal benefit as we discussed before).
- With one additional mechanism: After each round each player sees the contributions of the other players and can decide to deduct points from them (at own costs).
