## Demand & Supply

- A strong summer at the German Nordsee reduces hotel prices in Sicili, a famous artist dies and her art increases in price.
- Underlying mechanism of the functioning of markets.
- Determines the quantity of produced goods and their market prices.

## Demand

Relation between quantity and price as viewed by consumers.

Imagine a person with the following demand for ice cream:

| Price | Demanded Quantity (Alice) |
| ----- | ------------------------- |
| 0.0   | 12                        |
| 0.50  | 10                        |
| 1.00  | 8                         |
| 1.50  | 6                         |
| 2.00  | 4                         |
| 2.50  | 2                         |
| 3.00  | 0                         |

**Law of demand**: When prices increase, quantity demanded of a good (generally) decreases.

## Market forms

### (Or: why monopoly bad?)

- Typically, economists distinguish between three market forms. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - Perfect competition: Many firms, many consumers. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - Oligopoly: More than one firm, many consumers. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - Monopoly: One firm, many consumers. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- The more competition a firm faces, the less market power it has. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Market power: ability to affect the price (through choosing a certain production level). <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Special form of Oligopoly is the Duopoly with two firms, something that we see later.</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Market Form Examples

- Monopoly: <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - Postal services in many European countries. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - Railway services in many European countries. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Oligopoly: <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - Cloud provider (AWS, Google, ...) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - Mobile phone service. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Perfect Competition: <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - Consumer products with low barrier to entry (e.g., iced tea) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Why do we discuss this?

The current web2 landscape consists of several firms with a lot of market power in their respective market segment. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

We want to understand, from an economic perspective, why too much market power is not a good thing. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Perfect Competition

Under perfect competition, there are so many firms that a single firm's production quantity, $q$, does not affect the price, $p$, in the market.

That is, the firm takes the market price as given and solves:

$$\max_q pq - c(q)$$

Here, $c(q)$ is the cost function of the firm.
We usually assume that it is increasing and convex, $c'(q) > 0$, $c''(q)>0$.

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Draw a picture of $c$, explaining what convex means: increasing marginal cost; i.e., the more units you produce the more expensive an additional unit becomes. Second derivative is positive on the whole domain.</li>
<li>We assume convexity because of decreasing returns of scale (in a world of scarcity firms cannot forever increase their demand for goods without affecting price)</li>
<li>maximization problem d/dq = p - c&#39;(q) = 0</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Perfect Competition

- The optimal quantity $q$ satisfies $p = c'(q).$ <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- In the optimum, each firm will set its quantity so that its marginal cost, $c'(q)$, equals the market price. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- This makes sense: The firm produces up to the point where an additional unit costs exactly what it gets for it on the market. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Monopoly

- The monopolist is the single seller of the good or service and it serves the entire market. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Generally the market is characterized by a high barrier of entry (either by investment or legal restrictions). <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- The monopolist is price maker (by choosing quantity) and profit maximizer. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Monopoly

- In a monopoly, the monopolist can affect the price by choosing $q$.
- Suppose market demand is $P(q)$, where $P(q)$ is a decreasing function.
- Then, the problem of the monopolist is $$\max_q P(q)q-c(q).$$

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>q is the quantity of the produced good</li>
<li>Choosing q is exactly why a monopoly is a monopoly.</li>
<li>There is no supply curve for the monopolist, because it can set the price by setting a quantity!</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Monopoly

- The optimal quantity $q$ satisfies $$P(q)+P'(q)q = c'(q).$$
- This says: marginal revenue equals marginal cost.
- In the optimum, the monopoly produces up to the point where the revenue of an additional unit exactly equals the additional cost of producing it.
- Because demand is decreasing, $P'(q) < 0$, the price is above marginal cost, $P(q) > c'(q)$.

## Monopoly

> Most of the world's diamond supply comes from South African states. Assume that the marginal costs of mining a diamond is 1,000 USD and the demand function is characterized by $P(q) = 13,000 - q$

- Which price, quantity and hence profit emerges <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - under perfect competition? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - under a monopoly? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li><p>Perfect competition:</p>
<ul>
<li>We learned that under perfect competiton, p = marginal costs.</li>
<li>That means, p = 13,000 - q</li>
<li>1,000 = 13,000 - q</li>
<li>q = 12,000 under perfect competition.</li>
<li>Profit is p<em>q-c</em>q = $0</li>
<li>Note that the firm makes zero profit. Why? Because the barrier of entry (and exit) is so low, that firms would keep joining until the profit is at 0 - that is exactly what perfect competition means!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Monoploy:</p>
<ul>
<li>We learned that marginal cost equal marginal revenue.</li>
<li>Revenue is: $\pi = P(q)*q - c(q)$ -&gt; $\pi = (13,000-q)*q$ -&gt; $\frac{\delta \pi}{\delta q} = 13,000 - 2q$.</li>
<li>We set the marginal revenue to the marginal costs of 1000.</li>
<li>1000 = 13,000 - 2q</li>
<li>q* = 6000</li>
<li>profit = 36mio</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## The Problem with Monopoly

- As we have seen, the price is greater than marginal costs, $P^* > c'(q)$. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- There are consumers that would buy additional quantity at a slightly reduced price. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- These consumers would gain additional utility that is just below $P^*$ (because they are ready to buy at a price just below $P^*$). <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- On the other hand, the marginal cost describes the additional cost to the monopolist when slightly increasing $q$. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## The Problem with Monopoly

- Since the marginal cost is lower than the marginal gain to the consumers, total utility would increase when the monopolist would slightly increase $q$. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- From a utilitarian perspective, total welfare should be maximized in a market. This does not happen in a monopoly. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- The loss in welfare in a monopoly is sometimes referred to as a dead-weight loss. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## The Problem with Monopoly

Monopolies are bad because there are unrealized _gains from trade_!

- Often monopolies are deemed to be bad because they charge high prices to existing customers.
- This is _not_ the argument here. Here, monopolies are bad because they prevent potential buyers from buying _at all._
- Prices merely constitute a transfer. But transfers do not matter for the utilitarian who wants to maximize total welfare.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Oligopolies

- Oligopolies are somewhere between monopolies and perfect competition. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Because of the competition between firms, <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - prices are lower, <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - quantities higher, and <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - the unrealized gains from trade are lower. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What did we learn?

- Markets differ in how much market power the firms possess. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Economics typically distinguishes between three forms (ordered by increasing market power): <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - Perfect competition: many firms in the market. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - Oligopoly: few firms in the market. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - Monopoly: one firm in the market. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- The problem of monopoly is: unrealized gains from trade because monopolist set inefficiently low quantity, resulting in an inefficiently high price. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## Economics of Specialization

### (or: why trade good?)

> It is the maxim of every prudent master of a family, never to attempt to make at home what it will cost him more to make than to buy.

_(Adam Smith, 1776)_

- In this part, we take a closer look at the following concepts: <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - Comparative advantage. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - Opportunity costs. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - Gains from trade. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## A simple model of specialization and trade

- Consider Alice and Bob. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Both are farmers that can produce meat and tomatoes. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## What did we learn?

- Gains from trade arise because of comparative advantages. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Comparative advantage = lower opportunity cost. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Comparative advantages always exist (even in the presence of absolute advantages). <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- If everyone pursues her or his comparative advantage, then everyone can be made better off through trade. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>This is especially important to notice when collaborating in a team.</li>
<li>Despite having somebody the absolute advantage in many domains, it might still be good to specialize and delegate tasks</li>

## Behavioral Biases

- For a long time economic theory was built on the assumption that their actors were rational. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - No other-regarding preferences. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - Processes all available information efficiently. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - Not influenced by emotions. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- This works well in many circumstances (e.g., on an aggregate level or assuming highly rational actors like firms executives) but in many it doesn't <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Most humans are prone to Behavioral Biases and are influenced by social preferences. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## Behavioral Economics

- Behavioral economics is mainly concerned with the bounds of rationality of economic agents. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Influenced by psychological aspects such as emotions, cogntition as well as cultural and societal factors. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Daniel Kahnemann, a psychologist, received the 2002 Nobel Prize for Prospect Theory, a fundamental theory in Behavioral Economics. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - PT models the fact that individuals assess their losses differently than their gains. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## Behavioral Economics

### Behavior is not random! <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- Confirmation Bias: Decision makers focus on information that cater to their prior belief / opinion and neglect other information. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Sunk Cost Fallacy: Instead of cutting losses, decision makers continue to pour resources into a failed endeavour. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Herding Effect: Heuristic where people follow the crowd without making their own informed decision. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Gambler's Fallacy: In many situations probabilities of repeated events are independent from each other. Often decision makers fail to understand this. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Default Effect: People tend to stick with pre-selected choices. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Overconfidence: People overestimate their abilities. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Overconfidence: If asked, more than 50% of people think they drive above average. BUT has also positive effects.</li>

## Bitcoin Price Chart

<img src="../../../assets/img/2-Economics/2.1-bitcoin-price-chart.png" alt="Bitcoin Price Chart" style="width:700px; margin-top:0"/>

Based on what we’ve discussed about market equilibrium, why might the price of Bitcoin have peaked at `~$68,000` in December 2021? What market dynamics would have to have been true to hit that peak, and then what might have changed for the price to drop to the current price of `$21,000` only 6 months later?

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Open discussion with students. Answers to expect:<ul>
<li>Price movement over time. I.e., the result of a Demand &amp; Supply curve over time.</li>
<li>There is a shift in demand by expectations, (aggregated) income etc. all the previous factors that we described</li>
<li>Interestingly: Here is no shift in Supply if the protocol is seen as the producer of bitcoin!! It is fixed. However, the supply on the market does change.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This discussion will lead to discussing where the demand of a token comes from.</li>
<li>If possible: Grab this again in the discussion of inflation (i.e., the supply is increasing but deterministic, especially its independent of price)</li>
<li>Where does demand come from?</li>
<li>Why should Bitcoin have value?</li>

## Monopoly

- We have seen: Monopolists' market power leads to inefficient outcomes.
- In the model we considered, the monopolist chose too low a quantity, which yielded too high a price, and too little trade.
- Web 2.0 is full of firms that have a monopoly-like position in their respective domain:
  - Google
  - Uber
  - AirBnb
  - ...
- How do these firms exert their market power, if not over quantities?

## Game 1: Ultimatum game

- You are randomly matched with another student in the classroom. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- The interaction is anonymous. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Player 1 gets an endowment of 100 points. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Player 1 can offer Player 2 between 0 and 100 points. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Player 2 sees the offer and can decide to accept or reject the offer. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- If the offer is accepted, the endowment is split according to the offer. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- If the offer is rejected, both get 0 points. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Budget for the game $400. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## Conclusion

- We learned:
  - fundamental economic concepts that are important to navigate the blockchain space.
  - a few behavioral biases that cause humans to behave suboptimally.
  - to transfer the concepts to the blockchain space.
  - experienced economic concepts ourselves by playing a cournot competition.
