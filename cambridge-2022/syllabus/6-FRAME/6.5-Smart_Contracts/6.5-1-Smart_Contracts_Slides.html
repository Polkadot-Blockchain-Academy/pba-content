## Smart Contracts VS Pallets

<div class="flex-container">
<div class="left">

Additional layer of logic on top of a blockchain’s existing core logic.

- There are three safeguards in place to make Smart Contracts work properly and securely.
  - _Predefined Fees_: Ensure that contract developers are charged for computation and storage defined at runtime level.
  - _Sandbox_: Can't modify core blockchain storage or the storage of other contracts directly.
  - _Revert_: Reverting transactions when they fail so no state is updated when things go wrong.

In contrast, pallets are compiled together to create the base runtime of a parachain.
Runtime development has no safeguards against malicious actors and inexperienced developers.

</div>
</div>

<aside class="notes"><p>Smart contracts add an additional layer of logic on top of a blockchain’s existing core logic. One benefit of this structure is that anyone can build onto and recreate an existing smart contract and its runtime logic to create a modified version of a given code or protocol. A particularly important feature to smart contracts is the way they perform cross-contract calling to delegate and message other contracts. Anyone is capable of publishing smart contracts onto existing blockchains, including malicious actors and inexperienced developers. However, there are a number of safeguards for this.</p>
<p>In contrast, pallets are compiled together to create the base runtime of a parachain. Runtime development has no safeguards against malicious actors and inexperienced developers. You have full control of the underlying logic that each node on your network will run. You have full access to each and every storage item across all of your modules, which you can modify and control. You can even brick your chain with incorrect logic or poor error handling.</p>
<p>Pallets also provide granular control of transaction (TX) fees, allowing developers to be able to make certain, or all, TXs free. This implementation can get as specific as only charging fees when certain TX conditions are met.</p>
<p>All of this control provided by Substrate pallets creates a double-edged sword. More control in “bricking” or blocking your own chains means more room for errors, compared to smart contracts.</p>

## Smart Contracts Pallets

Substrate provides different Smart Contracts' options.

- Pallet Contracts - WASM execution environment
- Frontier - EVM execution environment

## Frontier

Frontier is the software suite that provides an Ethereum compatibility layer for Substrate.
It has two components that can be activated separately.

<img style="width: 1000px;" src="../../../assets/img/6-FRAME/6.5-Smart_Contracts/frontier/Frontier.png" alt="Frontier Logo">

<aside class="notes"><p><strong>Pallet EVM</strong>: This is the pallet that enables functionality of running EVM contracts. Existing EVM code can be used from there, using addresses and values mapped directly to Substrate.</p>
<p><strong>Pallet Ethereum</strong>: The pallet, combined with the RPC module, enables Ethereum block emulation, validates Ethereum-encoded transactions, and allows existing dapps to be deployed on a Substrate blockchain with minimal modifications.</p>
<p>A Web3 JS RPC call from a DApp or existing Ethereum developer tool, such as Truffle, is received by a Frontier node. The node will have both Web3 RPCs and Substrate RPCs available, which means that you can use Ethereum or Substrate tools when interacting with a Frontier node. These RPC calls are handled by associated Substrate runtime functions. The Substrate runtime checks signatures and handles any extrinsics. Smart contract calls are ultimately passed to the EVM to execute the state transitions.</p>

## Pallet EVM - AddressMapping

- Ethereum uses a 160-bit hex string as its public address.
- On Substrate, we call this format H160, for 160-bit hash.
- The EVM environment has its own balance called the EVM deposit, which can be withdrawn by Substrate native accounts.

<img style="width: 1000px;" src="../../../assets/img/6-FRAME/6.5-Smart_Contracts/frontier/EVM-accounts.png" alt="JS-Events">

<aside class="notes"><p>Ethereum uses a 160-bit hex string as its public address, which users can send and receive transactions. On Substrate, we call this format H160, for 160-bit hash. For a blockchain to be Ethereum-compatible, they must use H160 accounts, as that is the only account format that EVM and all tools within the Ethereum ecosystem will recognize. This rule applies to Substrate chains with the EVM pallet as well.</p>
<p>The EVM environment has its own balance called the EVM deposit, which can be withdrawn by Substrate native accounts. A native Substrate SS58 address can be converted to an H160 address that is mapped to an EVM deposit, and an EVM H160 address can be converted to an SS58 address. This allows the accounts to transfer tokens from the native balance to an EVM balance, and vice versa. However, this is a lossy conversion, so you cannot convert an SS58 to H160 and back to the same SS58 address. Furthermore, you can only sign transactions within the environment that the account was created. So for example, through normal ways, you cannot sign an EVM transaction with a native account or the other way around.</p>
