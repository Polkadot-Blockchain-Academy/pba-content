# Contracts Pallet

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>We have learned why smart contracts are useful and why we want to have them in out blockchain.</li>
<li>In order to offer this functionality we need to have a piece of software in our runtime that executes them</li>
<li>Substrate includes <code>pallet-contracts</code> which executes WebAssembly (wasm) based smart contracts</li>
<li>WebAssembly smart contracts only refer to the bytecode used to express the contracts</li>
<li>There are a lot of different ways you could implement a wasm based smart contract platform</li>
<li><code>pallet-contracts</code> is one opinionated way of doing this.
It stays purposefully close to the EVM way
of doing this (synchronous cross contract calls) while differentiating itself in some key areas.<ul>
<li>We will learn about this in the next chapter</li>

<li>WebAssembly (sometimes abbreviated Wasm) defines a portable binary-code format and a corresponding text format for executable programs as well as software interfaces for facilitating interactions between such programs and their host environment.</li>
<li>In order to understand how WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) contracts are constructed we just
need to understand the general concept.
No detailed knowledge is required.</li>
<li>However, because of its generality it can be used in other domains.</li>
<li>It is usally not written by hand but generated by a compiler.
In our case: Rust.<ul>
<li>Other languages exist targeting <code>pallet-contracts</code> and hence Wasm<ul>

## Minimal example

```Rust
fn factorial(n: u64) -> u64 {
  if n == 0 {
    1
  } else {
    n * factorial(n - 1)
  }
}
```

```WebAssembly
(func (param i64) (result i64)
  local.get 0     ;; stack[0] := n
  i64.eqz         ;; stack[0] := stack[0] == 0 ? 1 : 0
  if (result i64)
    i64.const 1   ;; stack[0] := 1
  else
    local.get 0   ;; stack[0] := n
    local.get 0   ;; stack[0] := n
    i64.const 1   ;; stack[0] := 1
    i64.sub       ;; stack[0] := stack[1] - stack[0]
    call 0        ;; stack[0] := factorial(stack[0])
    i64.mul       ;; stack[0] := stack[1] * stack[0]
  end
)

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>This format is called &#39;wat&#39; and is essentially a wasm assembler.</li>
<li>It is compiled to a binary format like any asm would be compiled to machine code.</li>
<li>As we can see here Wasm is a stack machine: Instructions push results to the stack and
use values on the stack as arguments.<ul>
<li>Register machines use registers for passing values to instructions as a primary mechanism.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Entities within a Wasm code file (Wasm module) are enumerated by their appearance (starting with 0).<ul>
<li>Calling the first defined function is accomplished via <code>call 0</code> for example</li>
<li>Parameters of functions are variables and are ordered before any variables of the function themselves.</li>
<li><code>local.get 0</code> fetches the first parameter of a function</li>

## Linear Memory

```Rust

<li>In addition to the stack Wasm also has linear memory.
This is byte addressable and can be manipulated
using <code>x.store</code> and <code>x.load</code> which stored and loads primitives from and to the stack.
Instructions
never operate directly on linear memory.<ul>
<li>The target address is taken from the stack and can be adjusted by passing an offset as immediate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Rust compiler uses for dynamic/heap memory and to pass non primitives to functions by emulating
an additional stack within the linear memory it allocates at some offset.<ul>
<li>This emulated stack is what we would understand as stack in other architectures.</li>
<li>The Wasm stack on the other would be implemented using registers in other architectures.</li>

## Embedding Wasm

<br>

<img src="../../../assets/img/6-FRAME/6.5-Smart_Contracts/pallet/wasm_embed.png" style="width: 1400px"/>

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>WebAssembly is meant to be embedded by other applications as a way to express logic in a platform
independent way.
The application including the WasmVM is called the &quot;embedder&quot;.
A programming
language that is often used in a similar way is LUA.
This is often called &quot;scripting&quot;.
&quot;Embedder&quot; is WebAssembly lingo and used in that way in the standard.</li>
<li>The embedder here is our blockchain&#39;s runtime which wants to execute some logic defined in
a platform independent way (contracts).</li>
<li>Another popular embedder is a web browser.</li>
<li>The embedder defines which functions can be called by the Wasm code and which functions it
expects to be present in the Wasm code.</li>

## Anatomy of a Contract

```WebAssembly
(module
  ;; params: data_ptr, data_len_ptr
  (import "seal0" "seal_input" (func $seal_input (param i32 i32)))
  (import "env" "memory" (memory 1 1))

  (func (export "deploy")
    ;; execute some code on contract deployment (we do nothing)
  )

  (func (export "call")
    ;; execute some code on contract execution
    (i32.store (i32.store 4) (i32.const 256)) ;; store the length of our buffer at mem[4]
    (call $seal_input (i32.const 0) (i32.const 4)) ;; copy input buffer to mem[0]
  )
)
```

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>The standard does not only include the binary instruction set but also the way the code is
bundled for consumption.</li>
<li>This bundle is called a Wasm module and is what an ELF file is to classical instruction sets.
It is
structured in that it contains different entities like functions, data and not only code that is to
be run.</li>
<li>Each embedder provides the environment.
The most important properties of this environment are:<ul>
<li>List of functions (&quot;imported functions&quot;) which can be called by the Wasm blob to interact with
the environment (e.G <code>seal_return</code>).
The identifier of an import consists of a <code>module</code> and a <code>name</code>.
Those don&#39;t have any meaning and can be chosen by the embedder completely arbitrarily.
While
any byte sequence can be used it is customary to make them human readable (ASCII).
The <code>module</code>
is usually used for namespacing.</li>
<li>List of entry points (&quot;exported functions&quot;) the the embedder expects to be present in the Wasm
module.
The embedder would call these functions at pre-defined points in time.
For example,
<code>pallet-contracts</code> expects two functions to be present: <code>deploy</code> and <code>call</code>.</li>
<li>Input and output is passed through linear memory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>pallet-contracts</code> acts as such an embedder and hence contracts are defined in terms of a Wasm
module according to the environment defined by <code>pallet-contracts</code>.</li>
<li><code>seal_input</code> is used to copy the input buffer to local memory where it can be further processed.<ul>
<li>Second argument is an in-out pointer which is used to pass in the buffer length and pass out
the actual size of the input.</li>
<li>Execution ends with an error if the specified buffer can&#39;t fit the whole input.</li>
<li>Every function offered by pallet-contracts that the contract wants to use needs to be
explicitly imported.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

## Architecture of pallet-contracts

## Dispatchables

<img src="../../../assets/img/6-FRAME/6.5-Smart_Contracts/pallet/arch_dispatchable.png" style="width: 1200px"/>

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Dispatchables are functions exposed by pallets than can be referenced in an signed extrinsic
in order execute some code on-chain.
For normal pallets this is fixed functionality.
For contracts however, we can trigger execution of previously stored (also using dispatchables)
Wasm code.</li>
<li>Once it is included into the runtime it makes the following dispatchables available for
a extrinsics (the argument list is shortened):<ul>
<li><code>upload_code(code: Vec&lt;u8&gt;)</code>: We differentiate between &quot;code&quot; and contract&quot;.
This uploads a Wasm module that can be referenced by its hash in other extrinsics.
It will validate, instrument and finally store the code on-chain.
With code we just mean a Wasm module while a contract is an account that has state attached to it that is governed by some previously uploaded code instead of a
private key.</li>
<li><code>instantiate(code_hash: CodeHash, input: Vec&lt;u8&gt;, salt: Vec&lt;u8&gt;)</code>: Creates a new contract using the specified
<code>code_hash</code>.
It&#39;s state is initialized by the <code>deploy</code> function defined in its code.
By branching
on the <code>input</code> different contract instances can be instantiated from the same code.
The contracts account id is derived deterministically:
<code>hash(instantiating_account ++ code_hash ++ salt)</code>.
Without the salt instantiating the same code
from the same account would be impossible.</li>
<li><code>call(account: AccountId, input: Vec&lt;u8&gt;)</code>: Call an existing contract.
This will execute the
<code>call</code> function exported by the contracts code.</li>

## RPCs

<img src="../../../assets/img/6-FRAME/6.5-Smart_Contracts/pallet/arch_rpc.png" style="width: 1000px" />

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>RPCs are functions exposed by a node via network</li>
<li>Some of them are general functions exposed by any node: (e.G <code>get_storage</code>)</li>
<li><code>pallet-contracts</code> adds additional RPC which are essentially mirrors of its dispatchables
to allow clients (wallets, dapps) to dry-run any contract execution before submitting it
as an extrinsic</li>
<li>The main reason to do dry runs to estimate gas usage and to extract data from a contract</li>
<li>For read-only contract executions a client would only call the RPC without submitting
an extrinsic as extrinsics can&#39;t return any data</li>
<li>RPCs do cannot mutate any state because they are only executed by one node as opposed to every
node as in the case of an extrinsic submission</li>

## API Definition

define_env!(Env, <E: Ext>,

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>The set of functions a contract can call (imported functions in Wasm lingo) are defined in
<code>wasm/runtime.rs</code> within the <code>define_env!</code> macro invocation.</li>
<li>The macro generates a list of imports from its arguments: The identifier in square brackets
becomes the <code>module</code> and the name of the functions becomes the <code>name</code>.</li>
<li>We use the <code>module</code> for versioning: To stay backwards compatible we add new versions of a function
instead of changing the existing one.
We increment the number behind <code>seal</code> for every new version.</li>
<li>The <code>__unstable__</code> module is for new functions whose API is not yet finalized.
Functions start out
in this module when they are added and can be changed because production deployments won&#39;t make this functions available.</li>
<li>The body of the functions is what is executed within the embedder (<code>pallet-contracts</code> in this case).</li>
<li>Only primitives (<code>i32</code>, <code>i64</code>) can be used as arguments or return tyoe.
Larger types are passed by
pointer and are serialized using SCALE.</li>
<li>This list of function can be extended by the runtime by a mechanism called chain extension.<ul>
<li>This is a type implementing <code>trait ChainExtension</code> passed in via the <code>Config</code> trait.</li>
</ul>

<li><code>gas</code> is a special import that is only called injected code in order to meter executed instructions.</li>

<li>Just as on ethereum we make use of gas metering in order to make sure a contract execution
terminates and fee the sender accordingly.</li>
<li>We don&#39;t need to do that for the runtime itself because that code is trusted to not use more
computation that that it promises to.
We can&#39;t trust contract code to do so because that code
can be uploaded by users as opposed to the author of the chain&#39;s runtime.</li>
<li>The concept of gas is unified with weight.
The word gas is sometimes used when talking about
smart contracts but it can be used interchangeably with weight.</li>
<li>As a reminder: One weight is one picosecond of execution time on whatever hardware was defined
as the reference for the runtime in question.</li>
<li>Just as for any other pallet there is a weight value assigned to each dispatchable.
However,
we can&#39;t know the a-priori weight for arbitrary code execution and therefore we need to resort
to metering:
The pre-dispatch weight is set to whatever is passed as the <code>gas_limit</code>.
After the execution we learn
the exact weight (post-dispatch weight) through metering and refund the difference.</li>
<li>We opt into that post-dispatch weight correcting by return <code>DispatchResultWithPostInfo</code>.</li>
<li>Metering works by assigning a weight value to each Wasm instruction and each imported function
and then dynamically keep track of what is used.</li>

## Execution Engine

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>After covering the structure of a contract and the pallet we have a look at the part which
actually runs the Wasm code.
Wasm is a virtual machine so we need some software to execute
it on out real world computer.</li>
<li>We call this part the &quot;execution engine&quot; and is the part that implements the Wasm instruction
set and actually runs the code.</li>
<li>Please note that this is often referred to as &quot;VM&quot; but this can be misleading because that
definition is blurry: Often it also includes embedder which would be the whole <code>pallet-contracts</code>.</li>
<li>We use the term &quot;execution engine&quot; to make this distinction clear.</li>
<li>An open question is whether it is worth it to use a (JIT) compiler instead of a an interpreter
for contracts.
Reason is that it is hard to tell whether the compilation overhead can be
recuperated by faster execution given the usually I/O heavy contract work loads.
This is why
we compare the two approaches in this chapter.</li>
<li>Interpreters<ul>
<li>Run through the code instruction by instruction</li>
<li>Slow to execute code when compared to a JIT compiler</li>
<li>Platform independent (can be included into runtime)</li>
<li>Immediate startup as no time is spent on compilation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>JIT<ul>
<li>Emit native assembly and executes it</li>
<li>Only single pass compilers can be used for contracts as optimizing compilers use non
linear algorithms which would be prone to DoS attacks.</li>
<li>Single pass compilers produce way slower code than optimizing compilers.</li>
<li>Cannot be included into the runtime</li>

<li>One way to deal with this situation is to charge rent from a contracts balance per block

It can be
reactivated re-uploading the state.</li>
<li>This leaves the contract in full control of its financing model because no assumptions
are made of wo pays for the storage: A contract could include logic to make users pays
for it or rely on some interested third party to keep it alive.</li>

the actual logic of the contract.

<li>Opinionated model where we dictate what whoever sends a transaction needs to pay for the
storage it creates.</li>
<li><code>pallet-contracts</code> automatically charges a deposit from the sender of a transaction if that
transaction creates storage.
In case that transaction removes storage the sender will get
a refund.
This incentivizes developers to write contracts in way that users are able
to remove unused storage.</li>
<li>This model is not as flexible as the rent model but it frees contract authors from dealing
with the potential threat of their contracts getting purged of their storage.</li>
<li>Takeaway here is that the biggest difference is that <strong>who</strong> is responsible for financing:<ul>
<li>Storage Rent: The <strong>contract</strong> and hence code.
The code could decide to make the user pay
for storage and implement something like storage deposits, theoretically.</li>

A contract cannot change this.

## Code sizes matter!

<br>

<img src="../../../assets/img/6-FRAME/6.5-Smart_Contracts/pallet/val.png" style="width: 1200px;"/>

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Every parachain block is re-executed by a set of relay chain validators as part of
the validation.
This is necessary to learn the side effects (storage changes) of that
block.
Those validators do not hold any storage of the parachain hence all the required
storage items needed for a block need to be sent to those validators along the block that
is to be validated.
We call that the storage proof or witness.</li>
<li>If a parachain contains <code>pallet-contracts</code> then those contract executions
(<code>call</code> extrinsics within a parachain block) also need to be re-executed by some
relay chain validators.
Those call extrinsics need the contract&#39;s code in order to be executed.
This means that for every unique contract referenced by a <code>call</code> extrinsic in a parachain block
this code needs to be send to the validator.
This happens for every block.
Wasm contracts tend
to be much larger (in the range of kilobytes) than the usual storage items.
This can make bandwidth
a bottleneck for the throughput of transactions: Sending around contract code during validation.</li>
<li>Solving this seems to be hard problem: No other blockchain has true sharding and smart contract.</li>
<li>We made a lot of progress with shrinking the contract sizes that ink! produces but it is still
an open question how to address this issue.
In the following we look into some planned solutions:</li>

## Shrink contract sizes

<br>

<img src="../../../assets/img/6-FRAME/6.5-Smart_Contracts/pallet/mapping.png" style="width: 1200px;"/>

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Probably the most obvious solution: Reduce the code sizes that our in-house programming language
(ink!) produces.
We made some great progress but we are still actively working on this.</li>
<li>The main contributor to contract size is doing storage management inside the contract.
We had some
complex storage types that are removed now.
We rely on a simple mapping type for now.
More storage functionality is build into <code>pallet-contracts</code> instead of the contracts itself
to save logic inside the contracts.</li>
<li>Another contributor to contract sizes are some properties of Rust:<ul>
<li>Code monomorphization</li>
<li>Passing large types by value</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Those Rust issues are largely unaddressed by now but will be taken care of eventually:<ul>
<li>We will integrate optimizations into LLVM that can help with fallout of monomorphization.</li>
<li>We will refactor the code to pass large types by reference and split large generic functions
so that only a small generic part will be duplicated by monomorphization.</li>

This will push the responsibility
of creating useful blocks of code (i.e that minimize amount of touched functions code per <code>call</code>)
to contract authors: It is in their interest to make their contracts cheap to execute.</li>
<li>More granular units (chunks of basic blocks) while looking promising have drawbacks:<ul>
<li>Tracking smaller units in the block builder incur a bigger performance overhead</li>
<li>The merkelized contract&#39;s trie will have more nodes and hence makes the witness larger</li>
