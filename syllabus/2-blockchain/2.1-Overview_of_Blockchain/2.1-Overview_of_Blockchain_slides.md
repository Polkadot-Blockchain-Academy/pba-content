* Todo  
 <!-- Fill in a description (and visual) of a blockchain -->

# A Brief History of Blockchain?

# What is a State Machine?

- Simple state machines and redundancy
- Fault tolerance in distributed systems
- How distributed state machines advance

 # Framework of Blockchain

- What does a blockchain provide? What is a blockchain solving?
- Neat overview of what problem blockchains solve?
- Cryptography Don't have to trust the conduit to have a reasonable expectation of privacy or of the origin of a message.
- Blockchain provides a service: don't need to trust a party to have guarantees.

# What service does Blockchain provide?

 - What is the service? What are the guarantees
    - Service
        - Shared computational resource
        - State machine
        - Many different parties who don't trust each other can interact
        - Logic is executed correctly
        - After some point, there is a very real expectation that it will not revert that state transition (append-only?)
        - Regardless of who you are, you have access to this machine- open access
    - Without intermediaries
        - Permissionless
        - Decentralized
        - Credible expectations of privacy and authenticity

- What are the nature of the solutions to these needs? - Anatomy of a Blockchain - Cryptographic Linked List (AKA Chained Blocks) - Each block has info coming in from external environment - Packets of information with zero or more signatures attached: we call these "Transactions" - **Axis 1:** Consensus Algorithms (How to 1) add blocks and 2) decide whether a block has been irrevertibly added?) - Consensus algorithm - 1 and 2 are combined in some algos and not in others - **Axis 2:** State Transition Funcion - Bitcoin: Spent output means that the output can no longer be spent again - Ethereum and Polkadot: State at the beginning of the block, at the end there is a deterministic alteration to a new state. - Polkadot:
  How do we come to a consensus about what a chain actually is? What are our 'service' guarantees - Whatever the accepted rules are for participation, they will be respected by the system. - Service will not be interrupted. - Respect the business logic - No systemic discrimination against the rules of the protocol - There could be rules that are necessary to provide the elements of service - Censorship-resistant - Two aspects of the service: - Liveness- always adding more transactions - When will a transaction be 'locked in' (and never reverted) - Bunch of participants in this multi-agent system who must determine what happens - Agreement on what's already been decided: Shared history - Two people will never have conflicting information and disagree. One might have MORE information, but the other will never believe that a different scenario is true. - Bitcoin - Smart Contract - Namecoin
- How does it actually work- trust without intermediaries?
  - Consensus Algorithms
    - Bitcoin (Nakomoto consensus/PoW)
      - PoW = Proof of Waste!
    - Proof of Authority (PoA)
      - Byzantine Agreement
      - Trust specific authorities to make the decisions
      - We want authorities that have stake in the system
      - Who gets to participate
        - PoW says everyone (weighted by hash power)
        - Requires special equipment, which is expensive
        - PoA says some finite set of authorities make decisions
    - Proof of Stake (PoS)
      - Longest chain PoS
      - PoS is an overloaded term; it might better be described as "Proof of Tokens"
      - Common security model; it continues
    - _Point of Confusion_: BABE, Tendermint, GRANDPA could also known as 'consensus algorithms'; - Which people are involved, how we get them involved.
      (history in academia and how it's used in Blockchain)
    - Individual consensus mechanisms that have PoS in their name
    - NPoS:
      - Staking
      - Rewarding
      - Balance Retention
      - Underlying Block Production
      - Finality Gadget
      - Nakomoto Consensus
      - Derivative Consensus (Parachain). derivative of a relay chain's finality system
  - State machine
- Consensus history

## Activities and Exercises

These activities can be done in the language of the student's choice:

- Write a blockchain that advances. It does not need an interface (e.g. to submit transactions), but it should maintain some state (e.g. a timestamp) and should produce new blocks (they can be empty, but the headers would of course be unique).
- Write a fork choice rule.
