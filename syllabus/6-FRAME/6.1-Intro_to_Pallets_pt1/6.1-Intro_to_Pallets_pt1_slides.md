## FRAME: Overview

Lecture 1, Module 6

Instructor: Kian / Shawn

Topics: FRAME, Pallets, System Pallet, Executive, Runtime Amalgamator

---v

## Agenda

- This is your first lecture on FRAME. Let's explore the way ahead before going further.
- Recall the following figure:

TODO: Figure 1

Notes:

Without frame, there is the runtime and there is the client, and an API that sits in between.

---v

- Same figure, but with FRAME

TODO: Figure 2

- By the end of this lecture, we revisit this, and you will fully understand this figure.

## 1. A Pallet

- An isolated unit of business logic that executes within a runtime.
- Can contain a variety of components, the most important ones are:
  - Dispatchable transactions
  - Storage items
  - Hooks for:
    - Block initialization,
    - Finalizing block
      - Not to be confused with finality gadget!

---v

- And some less important ones:
  - Events
  - Errors
  - Custom validation/communication with tx-pool
  - Offchain workers
  - A lot more! but you will learn about them later.

---v

### Config Trait.

```rust
// Every pallet has a `Config` trait. It contains everything configuration-related. A
// non-exhaustive list of examples below. In general, anything that you can do with a trait, you
// can do in your config.
//
// Note that we inherit from everything system!
#[pallet::config]
trait Config: frame_system::Config {
  // A hook about what to do.
  fn on_value_update(new_value: Self::ValueType);
  // An example of receiving an input type.
  type ValueType: Into<u32> + Codec + Default;
  // An example of receiving a const.
  const MAX_VALUE: u32;
}
```

---v

### Storage Items

```rust
// T::AccountId comes from system, T::ValueType comes form us.
#[pallet::storage]
pub type Accumulators<T: Config> = StorageMap<_, T::AccountId, T::ValueType>;
// A simpler storage item.
#[pallet::storage]
pub type Counter<T: Config> = StorageValue<_, u32>;
```

---v

### Transactions

```rust
/// This a struct that will implement all of the transactions as associated functions.
#[pallet::pallet]
pub struct Pallet<T>(PhantomData<T>);

#[pallet::call]
impl<T: Config> Pallet<T> {
  // this a dummy transaction that allows any user to submit a number (that is converted to
  // `ValueType`) exactly once. It already increments a counter everyone someone submits something
  // new. a maximum of `Config::MAX_VALUE` is allowed, and the associated hooks are called.
  #[pallet::weight(unimplemented!())]
  pub fn inc_user_counter(origin: OriginFor<T>, inc: u32) -> DispatchResult {
    // checks the origin to be signed -- more on this later.
    let who = ensure_signed(origin)?;

    // check that this user has not submitted already.
    if !<Accumulators<T>>::contains_key(who) {
      // increment the counter .
      Counter::<T>::mutate(|x| x += 1);

      // get the accumulator associated with this user.
      let mut current = Accumulators::<T>::get(who);
      // convert `inc` to `ValueType`.
      current += inc.into();
      // check reaching .
      if current > T::MAX_VALUE {
        return Err("failed".into())
      }

      // all good! call hook..
      T::on_value_update(current);
      // ..and write to storage.
      Accumulators::<T>::put(current);
    } else {
      return Err("already submitted".into())
    }

    Ok(())
  }
}
```

note:

- expand `DispatchError`, and how you can convert from string into it.
- expand `OriginFor`.
- touch on "check-first, write last" and how currently we have `#[transactional]` almost by default.

---v

### Hooks

```rust
#[pallet::hooks]
impl<T: Config> Hooks<BlockNumberFor<T>> for Pallet<T> {
  fn on_initialize(n: T::BlockNumber) -> Weight {
    if n % 10 == Zero::zero() {
      log::info!("count of users is {}", Counter::<T>::get());
    }
  }

  fn on_finalize(_n: T::BlockNumber) {
    // other stuff..
  }
}
```

note: TODO: should this be a jupyter notebook instead? It cannot be compiled, but it is more code than
text.

---v

### The Expanded Version of This Bad Boy.

- The frame macros do a lot of things for us under the hood!
- Let's peek at a few of the things that they generate.

---v

- `Pallet` implements the transactions as public functions.
- `enum Call` that has in itself is just an encoding of the transaction's data
- and implements `UnfilteredDispatchable` (which just forward the call back to `Pallet`)

- And that's about it! Now let's look at what is this `frame_system` that everyone has to rely on.

---

## 2. The System Pallet

- The system pallet is a container for all the common things that all pallet need:
  - common types
- Moreover, it handles some system-level operations, such as
  - `set_code`
  - `set_storage`
  - ..
- And some system-level metering/accounting, such as:
  - extrinsic count/length/weight(gas)
  - what's the current block number?
- Finally it stores all of the accounts as well, although this can be easily changed\*.

---v

### Config Trait: Common Types

```rust
#[pallet::config]
pub trait Config: {
	// this is touched upon in the previous section:
   type AccountId;

   // these are not, but should still be comprehensible.
   type Index;
   type BlockNumber;
   type AccountData;
   type Hashing;
   type Hash;
   type Header;
}
```

---v

### Storage Items: Accounting and Metering

- The key to to understanding them is to know they are transient!
  - set during block execution, deleted in the beginning of the next block.

```rust
#[pallet::storage]
pub(super) type ExtrinsicCount<T: Config> = StorageValue<_, u32>;
#[pallet::storage]
pub(super) type AllExtrinsicsLen<T: Config> = StorageValue<_, u32>;
#[pallet::storage]
pub(super) type ExtrinsicData<T: Config> = StorageMap<_, Twox64Concat, u32, Vec<u8>, ValueQuery>;
#[pallet::storage]
pub(super) type Number<T: Config> = StorageValue<_, T::BlockNumber, ValueQuery>;
#[pallet::storage]
pub(super) type ParentHash<T: Config> = StorageValue<_, T::Hash, ValueQuery>;
```

---v

### And Accounts..

```rust
pub struct AccountInfo<Index, AccountData> {
	pub nonce: Index,
	pub consumers: RefCount,
	pub providers: RefCount,
	pub sufficients: RefCount,
	pub data: AccountData,
}

#[pallet::storage]
pub type Account<T: Config> = StorageMap<
	_,
	Blake2_128Concat,
	T::AccountId,
	AccountInfo<T::Index, T::AccountData>,
	ValueQuery,
>;
```

---

## 3. `construct_runtime!` and Runtime Amalgamator.

- Now, let's look at a minimal runtime amalgamator.
- This is where you glue the runtime together, and expose the things you care about as runtime apis.

Notes:

---

## 4. Executive

1. I present to you, Executive struct:

```rust
pub struct Executive<
  System,
  Block,
  Context,
  UnsignedValidator,
  AllPalletsWithSystem,
  OnRuntimeUpgrade = (),
>(
  PhantomData<(
    System,
    Block,
    Context,
    UnsignedValidator,
    AllPalletsWithSystem,
    OnRuntimeUpgrade,
  )>,
);
```

---v

#### Expanding The Generic Types.

```rust
impl<
    // System config, we know this now.
    System: frame_system::Config + EnsureInherentsAreFirst<Block>,
    // Constrained generics! understanding such syntax is key in rest of FRAME.
    // Rust recap: associated types are like output, generics are like input.
    Block: sp_runtime::traits::Block<Header = System::Header, Hash = System::Hash>,
    // Ignore for now.
    Context: Default,
    // Ignore for now.
    UnsignedValidator,
    // Something that has all the hooks. We don't know anything else about pallets here.
    AllPalletsWithSystem: OnRuntimeUpgrade
      + OnInitialize<System::BlockNumber>
      + OnIdle<System::BlockNumber>
      + OnFinalize<System::BlockNumber>
      + OffchainWorker<System::BlockNumber>,
    // Ignore for now.
    COnRuntimeUpgrade: OnRuntimeUpgrade,
  > Executive<System, Block, Context, UnsignedValidator, AllPalletsWithSystem, COnRuntimeUpgrade>
where
  // This is the juicy party, and we have to learn more sp_runtime traits to follow.
  Block::Extrinsic: Checkable<Context> + Codec,
  CheckedOf<Block::Extrinsic, Context>: Applyable + GetDispatchInfo,
  CallOf<Block::Extrinsic, Context>:
    Dispatchable<Info = DispatchInfo, PostInfo = PostDispatchInfo>,
  OriginOf<Block::Extrinsic, Context>: From<Option<System::AccountId>>,
  UnsignedValidator: ValidateUnsigned<Call = CallOf<Block::Extrinsic, Context>>,
{...}
```

---v

#### `Block::Extrinsic: Checkable<_>`

- Who implements `Checkable`?
- That's right, the `generic::UncheckedExtrinsic` that we indeed used as `Block::Extrinsic` in the
  top level runtime. Recall:

```rust
type UncheckedExtrinsic = generic::UncheckedExtrinsic<_, _, _, _>;
type Header = ..
type Block = generic::Block<Header, UncheckedExtrinsic>;
type Executive = frame_executive::Executive<_, Block, ...>;
```

---v

#### What Does `Checkable<_>` Do?

```rust
impl Checkable<_> for UncheckedExtrinsic<_, _, _, _> {
  // this is the output type.
  type Checked = CheckedExtrinsic<AccountId, Call, Extra>;

  fn check(self, lookup: &Lookup) -> Result<Self::Checked, TransactionValidityError> {
    Ok(match self.signature {
      Some((_)) => {
        // signature verification
        CheckedExtrinsic { signed: .., function: self.function }
      },
      None => {
        // nothing to do, this is not signed.
        CheckedExtrinsic { signed: None, function: self.function },
      }
		})
	}
}
```

---v

#### `CheckedOf<Block::Extrinsic, _>: Applyable`

- `UncheckedExtrinsic::Checked` is `CheckedExtrinsic`.
- And it surely does implement `Applyable`

---v

#### What Does `Applyable<_>` Do?

- TLDR: `Ok(self.call.dispatch(maybe_who.into()))`

---v

#### And Don't Forget: `Applyable::Call: Dispatchable<_, _>`

- And guess who implemented `Dispatchable`, which we already looked at!
- The `enum Call` that we had in our expanded file!

---v

### Circling Back..

So, to recap:

```rust
struct Runtime;

impl frame_system::Config for Runtime {}
impl simple_pallet::Config for Runtime {}

enum Call {
  System(frame_system::Call<Runtime>),
  SimplePallet(simple_pallet::Call<Runtime>),
}

impl Dispatchable for Call {
  fn dispatch(self, origin: _) -> Result<_, _> {
    match self {
      Call::System(system_call) => system_call.dispatch(),
      Call::SimplePallet(simple_pallet_call) => system_pallet_call.dispatch(),
    }
  }
}

struct UncheckedExtrinsic {
  function: Call,
  signature: Option<_>,
}

type Executive = Executive<_, UncheckedExtrinsic, ...>;

let unchecked = UncheckedExtrinsic::new();
let checked = unchecked.check();
let _ = checked.apply();
```

---v

### Let's Put It All Together

- in the context of how the executive's `fn execute_block` is working under the hood, with some simplifications:

```rust
fn execute_block(block: Block) {
	// get some info out of the block.
	let (header, extrinsics) = block.deconstruct()
	let block_number = header.number();
	let parent_hash = header.parent_hash();

	// initialize the block, including all the on-initialize hooks.
	// go to the impl and see how this is clearing previous TRANSIENT stuff.
	<frame_system::Pallet<System>>::initialize(block_number, parent_hash, digest);

	// execute extrinsics.
    extrinsics.into_iter().for_each(|uxt: UncheckedExtrinsic| {
		// recall how `Block::Extrinsic` was UncheckedExtrinsic, thus `uxt: UncheckedExtrinsic `
		// first, go through `Checkable`, where the signature is checked.
    	let xt: CheckedExtrinsic = uxt.check(&Default::default())?;
		// then `Applyable`, where actual `.dispatch` is called.
		let dispatch_info = xt.get_dispatch_info();
		let _ = Applyable::apply::<_>(xt, &dispatch_info, encoded_len);
    });

	// execute some other hooks
    <AllPalletsWithSystem as OnIdle<System::BlockNumber>>::on_idle(block_number);
	<AllPalletsWithSystem as OnFinalize<System::BlockNumber>>::on_finalize(block_number);

	// finally check roots.
	let new_storage_root = sp_io::storage::root(version)[..];
    assert!(header.state_root() == new_storage_root, "Storage root must match that calculated.");
	let new_extrinsic_root = todo!();
    assert!(
    	header.extrinsics_root() == new_extrinsic_root,
    	"Transaction trie root must be valid.",
    );
}
```

## Recap:

- What we did here was basically twofold:

1. We jumped into the detail of the figure that we showed at the beginning of the lecture and tried
   to explore each component a little bit.
2. we explored the `Call` enum a little bit more. There are many more types and sub-systems to
   explore, this was just a demo!
