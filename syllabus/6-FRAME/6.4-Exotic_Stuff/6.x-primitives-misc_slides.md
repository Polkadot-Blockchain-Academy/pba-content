## Substrate Primitives

A random collection of things that you should probably know about.

These are relevant for coding in FRAME and Substrate.

---

## `trait Block`, `Header`, `Extrinsic`

Generic definitions of what each of these *should be*..

.. One implementation of which can be found in `generic` folder.

---v

### `trait Block`, `Header`, `Extrinsic`

..and you should be well versed in reading such type aliases:


```rust
/// Extract the hashing type for a block.
pub type HashFor<B> = <<B as Block>::Header as Header>::Hashing;
/// Extract the number type for a block.
pub type NumberFor<B> = <<B as Block>::Header as Header>::Number;
```

or..

```rust
type BalanceOf<T, I> = <
  <T as Config<I>>::Currency
  as
  Currency<<T as frame_system::Config>::AccountId>
>::Balance;
```


---

## `trait Get`

A very basic, yet very substrate-idiomatic way to pass values through types.

Generally, we love playing we *types* in substrate.

```rust
pub trait Get<T> {
  fn get() -> T;
}

impl<T: Default> Get<T> for () {
  fn get() -> T {
    T::default()
	}
}
```

---v

### `trait Get`

```rust
parameter_types! {
  pub const Foo: u32 = 10;
}

// expands to:
pub struct Foo;
impl Get<u32> for Foo {
  fn get() -> u32 {
    10;
  }
}
```

This 10 could be coming from a `const` context, which means it is one less value stored in the
stack/memory, nonetheless it could be coming from anywhere.


---

## `bounded`

- `BoundedVec`, `BoundedSlice`, `BoundedBTreeMap`, `BoundedSlice`

```rust
#[cfg_attr(feature = "std", derive(Serialize), serde(transparent))]
#[derive(Encode)]
pub struct BoundedVec<T, S: Get<u32>>(
	pub(super) Vec<T>,
	#[cfg_attr(feature = "std", serde(skip_serializing))] PhantomData<S>,
);
```

---v

### `bounded`

Food for your thought.

```rust
#[cfg_attr(feature = "std", derive(Serialize))]
#[derive(Encode)]
pub struct BoundedVec<T>(
	pub(super) Vec<T>,
  u32
);
```

---

## `trait Convert`

```rust
pub trait Convert<A, B> {
	fn convert(a: A) -> B;
}

pub struct Identity;
impl<T> Convert<T, T> for Identity {
	fn convert(a: T) -> T {
		a
	}
}
```

---v

### Example of `Get` and `Convert`

```rust
/// Some configuration for my module.
trait InputConfig {
  /// Something that gives you a `usize`.
  type MaximumSize: Get<usize>
  /// Something that is capable of coverting `u64` to `u32`.
  type ImpossibleConvertor: Convertor<u64, u32>;
}

struct Module<T: Config> {
  fn foo() {
    let outcome: u32 = T::ImpossibleConvertor::convert(u64::max_value());
  }
}
```

---

## The `std` Paradigm


All crates in substrate that eventually compile to WASM are compiled without the std library, i.e.
  in `no_std` mode.

The main implication is that the standard library (`std`) is not available.

```rust
#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), no_std)]
```

> The name "`std`" is just an idiom in the rust ecosystem.

This means you import your crates with `"default-features = false"`, and enable their `"std"`
feature conditionally.

> `feature = "std"` implies: Native, or tests only. a

---v

### The `std` Paradigm

A subset of the standard types in rust that also exist in rust `core` are re-exported from `sp_std`.

> The Rust Core Library is the dependency-free1 foundation of The Rust Standard Library. It is the portable glue between the language and its libraries, defining the intrinsic and primitive building blocks of all Rust code. It links to no upstream libraries, no system libraries, and no libc.

```rust
sp_std::prelude::*;
```

> A `HashMap`, even though it is in `core`, is not re-exported because it *can be* non-deterministic*.

---v

### The `std` Paradigm

```rust
#[cfg(feature = "std")]
#[macro_export]
macro_rules! if_std {
	( $( $code:tt )* ) => {
		$( $code )*
	}
}

#[cfg(not(feature = "std"))]
#[macro_export]
macro_rules! if_std {
	( $( $code:tt )* ) => {};
}
```

---

### Logging And Prints In The Runtime.

First, why the fuss? Any logging increases the size of the WASM blob, and sometimes size matters.

All of those string literals that you want to print are literally somewhere in the wasm code (or
any native binary, for that matter).

---v

### Logging And Prints In The Runtime.

- `Debug` vs. `RuntimeDebug`

```rust
#[derive(RuntimeDebug)]
pub struct WithDebug {
    foo: u32,
    bar: u32,
}

#[automatically_derived]
#[allow(unused_qualifications)]
impl ::core::fmt::Debug for WithDebug {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut ::core::fmt::Formatter) -> ::core::fmt::Result {
        #[cfg(feature = "std)]
        {
          fmt.debug_struct("WithRuntimeDebug")
            .field("foo", &self.foo)
            .field("bar", &self.bar)
            .finish()
        }
        #[cfg(not(feature = "std))]
        {
          fmt.write("<wasm:stripped>")
        }
    }
}
```

---v

### Logging And Prints In The Runtime.

Once types implement `Debug`, they can be printed. Various ways:

If you only want something in tests, native builds etc

```rust
sp_std::if_std! {
  println!("hello world!")
}
```

Or you can use the common frame-support logging (which is just the `log` crate re-exported):

```rust
frame_support::log::info!(target: "target", "hello world!");
frame_support::log::debug!(target: "target", "hello world! ({})", 10u32);

// Question: when is this line even evaluated?
frame_support::log::trace!(target: "target", "({:?})", (0..100000).into_iter().collect());
```

Assuming you have the right `LOG_TARGET`, and no `disable-logging` feature.

NOTE:

`log` in rust does not do anything -- it only tracks what needs to be logged. Then you need a logger
to actually export them. In rust this is often `env_logger` or `sp_tracing` in substrate tests.

In the runtime, the log messages are sent via the host functions to the client to be printed.

If the interface is built with `disable-logging`, it omits all log messages.

## Arithmetic Helpers, and the `f32`, `f64` Story.

Floating point numbers have different standards, and (***slightly***) different implementations on
different architectures and vendors.

> If my balance is `10.000000000000001` DOT on one validator and `10.000000000000000` DOT on another
> validator, game over for your consensus.


---v

### PerThing.

```python
> .2 + .2 + .2 == .6
> false
```

```
> a = 10
> b = 0.1
> c = 0.2
> a*(b+c) == a*b + a*c
> false
```

Google "weird float behavior" fro more entertainment around this.

---v

### PerThing.

- We store ratios and such in the runtime with "Fixed-Point" arithmetic types.

```rust
implement_per_thing!(
  Percent,
  100u8,
  u8,
  "_Percent_"
);
implement_per_thing!(
	PerU16,
	65535_u16,
	u16,
	"_Parts per 65535_",
);
implement_per_thing!(
	Permill,
	1_000_000u32,
	u32,
	"_Parts per Million_",
);
implement_per_thing!(
	Perbill,
	1_000_000_000u32,
	u32,
	"_Parts per Billion_",
);
implement_per_thing!(
	Perquintill,
	1_000_000_000_000_000_000u64,
	u64,
	"_Parts per Quintillion_",
);
```

---v

### PerThing.

```
let p = Perbill::from_part_parts(1_000_000_000u32 / 4);
let p = Perbill::from_percent(25);
let p = Perbill::from_rational(1, 4);

> p * 100u32;
> 25u32;
```

Some precision concerns exist, but that's a story for another day.

---v

### Fixed Point Numbers

`Per-thing` is great for representing `[0, 1]` range.

What if we need more?

```
100 ~ 1
200 ~ 2
300 ~ 3
350 ~ 3.5
```

---v

### Fixed Point Numbers

```rust
implement_fixed!(
	FixedI64,
	i64,
	1_000_000_000,
	"_Fixed Point 64 bits signed, range = [-9223372036.854775808, 9223372036.854775807]_",
);

implement_fixed!(
	FixedU64,
	u64,
	1_000_000_000,
	"_Fixed Point 64 bits unsigned, range = [0.000000000, 18446744073.709551615]_",
);

implement_fixed!(
	FixedI128,
	i128,
	1_000_000_000_000_000_000,
	"_Fixed Point 128 bits signed, range = \
		[-170141183460469231731.687303715884105728, 170141183460469231731.687303715884105727]_",
);

implement_fixed!(
	FixedU128,
	u128,
	1_000_000_000_000_000_000,
	"_Fixed Point 128 bits unsigned, range = \
		[0.000000000000000000, 340282366920938463463.374607431768211455]_",
);

```

---v

### Fallibility

**Conversions** are very much fallible operations. So is things like addition, multiplication,
division (all in `std::ops`, if keen on reading some rustdocs).

- Panic

`u32::MAX * u32::MAX / 2` (in debug builds)

`100 / 0`

- Overflow

`u32::MAX * u32::MAX / 2` (in release builds)

---v

### Fallibility

1. `Checked` -- recover

`if let Some(outcome) = a.checked_mul(b) { ... } else { ... }`

2. `Saturating` -- soft recovery

`let certain_output = a.saturating_mul(b);`

<hr>

There's also `wrapping_op` and `carrying_op` etc on all rust primitives, but not quite relevant.

https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.u32.html


---v

### Fallibility

Luckily, rust is already pretty strict here.

- `TryInto` / `TryFrom` / `From<u32>` / `Into`


```rust
/// T is u32 or larger.
struct Foo<T: From<u32>>

/// T is u32 or smaller
struct Foo<T: Into<u32>>

/// It can maybe be converted to u32
struct Foo<T: TryInto<u32>>

/// It can be converted into u32 at the cost of loss of accuracy.
/// This is a substrate trait.
struct Foo<T: UniqueSaturatedInto<u32>>

assert_eq!(u128::MAX.saturating_into::<u32>(), u32::MAX);
```

---v

###Larger Types

- `U256`, `U512`: battle-tested since the ethereum days.
- substrate-fixed: community project. Supercharged `PerThing` and `Fixed`.
- `big_uint.rs` (unaudited)

```rust

pub struct BigUint {
	/// digits (limbs) of this number (sorted as msb -> lsb).
	pub(crate) digits: Vec<Single>,
}
```

- Rust didn't have u128 until not too long ago! https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/163/files
- `TryFrom`/`TryInto` are also not too old! https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/163/files#r188938077
- Remove `As`, which tried to fill the lack of `TryFrom/TryInto` https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/2602
