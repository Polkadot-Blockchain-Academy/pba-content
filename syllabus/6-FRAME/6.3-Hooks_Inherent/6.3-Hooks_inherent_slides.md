## Hooks: All In One

https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/33c518ebbe43d38228ac47e793e4d1c76738a56d/frame/support/src/traits/hooks.rs#L214

```rust
/// The pallet hooks trait. Implementing this lets you express some logic to execute.
pub trait Hooks<BlockNumber> {
  /// The block is being initialized. Implement to have something happen.
	///
	/// Return the non-negotiable weight consumed in the block.
	fn on_initialize(_n: BlockNumber) -> crate::weights::Weight {
		0
	}

	/// The block is being finalized. Implement to have something happen.
	fn on_finalize(_n: BlockNumber) {}

	/// This will be run when the block is being finalized (before `on_finalize`).
	/// Implement to have something happen using the remaining weight.
	/// Will not fire if the remaining weight is 0.
	/// Return the weight used, the hook will subtract it from current weight used
	/// and pass the result to the next `on_idle` hook if it exists.
	fn on_idle(
		_n: BlockNumber,
		_remaining_weight: crate::weights::Weight,
	) -> crate::weights::Weight {
		0
	}

	/// Perform a module upgrade.
	///
	/// NOTE: this doesn't include all pallet logic triggered on runtime upgrade. For instance it
	/// doesn't include the write of the pallet version in storage. The final complete logic
	/// triggered on runtime upgrade is given by implementation of `OnRuntimeUpgrade` trait by
	/// `Pallet`.
	///
	/// # Warning
	///
	/// This function will be called before we initialized any runtime state, aka `on_initialize`
	/// wasn't called yet. So, information like the block number and any other block local data are
	/// not accessible.
	///
	/// Return the non-negotiable weight consumed for runtime upgrade.
	///
	/// While this function can be freely implemented, using `on_runtime_upgrade` from inside the
	/// pallet is discouraged and might get deprecated in the future. Alternatively, export the same
	/// logic as a free-function from your pallet, and pass it to `type Executive` from the
	/// top-level runtime.
	fn on_runtime_upgrade() -> crate::weights::Weight {
		0
	}

	/// Execute some pre-checks prior to a runtime upgrade.
	///
	/// This hook is never meant to be executed on-chain but is meant to be used by testing tools.
	#[cfg(feature = "try-runtime")]
	fn pre_upgrade() -> Result<(), &'static str> {
		Ok(())
	}

	/// Execute some post-checks after a runtime upgrade.
	///
	/// This hook is never meant to be executed on-chain but is meant to be used by testing tools.
	#[cfg(feature = "try-runtime")]
	fn post_upgrade() -> Result<(), &'static str> {
		Ok(())
	}

	/// Implementing this function on a module allows you to perform long-running tasks
	/// that make (by default) validators generate transactions that feed results
	/// of those long-running computations back on chain.
	///
	/// NOTE: This function runs off-chain, so it can access the block state,
	/// but cannot preform any alterations. More specifically alterations are
	/// not forbidden, but they are not persisted in any way after the worker
	/// has finished.
	///
	/// This function is being called after every block import (when fully synced).
	///
	/// Implement this and use any of the `Offchain` `sp_io` set of APIs
	/// to perform off-chain computations, calls and submit transactions
	/// with results to trigger any on-chain changes.
	/// Any state alterations are lost and are not persisted.
	fn offchain_worker(_n: BlockNumber) {}

	/// Run integrity test.
	///
	/// The test is not executed in a externalities provided environment.
	fn integrity_test() {}
}

## Hooks: `On_Initialize`

- Hooks should be lightweight and predictable

- MUST HAVE Bounded complexity

```rust
fn on_initialize() -> Weight {
  // any user can create one entry in `MyMap`.
  <MyMap<T>>::iter().for_each(do_stuff);
}
```

- The weight you return is returned as `DispatchClass::Mandatory`.

- It is called once we `initialize_block` from the runtime API.
  - At the beginning of block-building
  - At the beginning of block execution

- It is called before any transaction in a block is called.

- Question: If you have 3 pallets, in which order they are called?
- Question: If your runtime panics on_initialize, how can you recover from it?
- Question: If your hook consumes more than the maximum block weight, as a solo-chain?
- Question: If your hook consumes more than the maximum block weight, as a para-chain?

- Useful for doing automatic scheduled operations:
  - scheduler pallet
  - staking deferred slashes


---

## Hooks: `on_finalize`

- Its weight needs to be known in advance. Therefore, less preferred compared to `on_initialize`
- Called at the end of each block execution.

- Its weight need to be reported in advance by `on_initialize`.

- Similar to `on_initialize`, `on_finalize` is also **mandatory**. This is also why its weight is
  registered at the beginning of the block.

> Generally, avoid using it unless if something REALLY needs to be happen at the end of the block.


Sometimes, rather than thinking "at the end of block N", consider writing code "at the beginning of block N+1"

---

## Hooks: `on_idle`

- *Optional* variant of `on_finalize`, also executed at the end of the block.


---

## Hooks: `on_runtime_upgrade`

Called once per every time that the runtime version changes, before anything else.

Your one and only chance to migrate the state if needed.

Has its own lecture!

---

## Hooks: `offchain_worker`

Fully offchain application:
- Read chain state via RPC
- submit desired side effects back to the chain as transactions

Runtime Offchain Worker:
- Code lives onchain, upgradable only in synchrony with the whole runtime üëé
- Ergonomic and fast state access üëç
- State writes are ignored ü§∑
- Can submit transactions back to the chain as well ‚úÖ

Called per block, has a totally separate thread pool than the normal execution.

Threads can overlap, each is reading the state of its corresponding block, and you can great
`lock`s if needed to make sure there is no overlap.


https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/49b06901eb65f2c61ff0934d66987fd955d5b8f5/frame/election-provider-multi-phase/src/lib.rs#L789

```rust
fn offchain_worker(now: T::BlockNumber) {
  let mut lock = StorageLock::<_>::with_block_deadline(.., duration);
  match lock.try_lock() {
    Ok(_guard) => {
      Self::do_synchronized_offchain_worker(now);
    },
    Err(deadline) => {
      log!(debug, "offchain worker lock not released, deadline is {:?}", deadline);
    },
  };
}
```

Offchain workers have their own special host functions.

Offchain workers have the same execution limits as WASM (limited memory, custom allocator).

Word on allocator limit in Substrate WASM execution (subject to change).
- Max single allocation limited
- Max total allocation limited.

---

## Hooks: `integrity_test`

Called upon `construct_runtime!` only.

Best to make sure all the inputs coming into your pallet as `type Foo: Get<u32> = ..` are sensible!

> Panic, panic all you want in here.

```rust
fn integrity_test() {
  assert!(
    T::MaxPointsToBalance::get() > 0,
    "Minimum points to balance ratio must be greater than 0"
  );
}
```

---

## Hooks: Inherents

---

## Hooks: Execution Order

Look into executive pallet and see the order of execution in there.

---

## Hooks: `genesis_build`

```rust
// in your pallet
#[pallet::genesis_config]
pub struct GenesisConfig<T: Config> {
  pub max_pools: Option<u32>,
  pub max_members: Option<u32>,
}

#[cfg(feature = "std")]
impl<T: Config> Default for GenesisConfig<T> {
  fn default() -> Self {
    Self {
      max_pools: Some(16),
      max_members: Some(16 * 32),
    }
  }
}

#[pallet::genesis_build]
impl<T: Config> GenesisBuild<T> for GenesisConfig<T> {
  fn build(&self) {
    if let Some(max_pools) = self.max_pools {
  		MaxPools::<T>::put(max_pools);
  	}
  	if let Some(max_members) = self.max_members {
  		MaxPoolMembers::<T>::put(max_members);
  	}
  }
}
```

Later on, a `struct GenesisConfig` is generated per pallet, which can be populated on the client
side.

## Further Reading, Recap.

- Hooks are very powerful tools to write state transition, but with them it comes a lot of
  responsibility as well.
