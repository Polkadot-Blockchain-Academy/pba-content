# Polkadot‚Äôs Nominated Proof of Stake

What, Why, How?

## Why Proof of Stake Ser?

Why do we use PoS?


<div>

Economic Security üí∏ü§ë

Tokens locked + prone to being slashed.

Everything else (finality, parachains, etc.) is built on top of this assumption

## What is NPoS: Assumptions

Assumptions:

Validators: those who wish to author blocks.
Nominators/Delegators: Those who wish to support wanna-be authors.

Validation and nomination intentions can change, therefore we need periodic elections to always
choose the best validators + hold them slashable.

Every election period is called an *Era*, e.g. 24hrs.

---v

### What is NPoS: Re-inventing the Wheel

**Solo-POS**

Authority-wanna-bees aka. validators bring their own stake. No further participation. Top validators
are elected.

NOTE:

Low amount of stake that we can capture, impossible for those who don't want to run the hardware to join.

---v

### What is NPoS: Re-inventing the Wheel


**Single-Delegation-POS**

Anyone can dilute themselves in any given validators. Top validator based on total stake are elected.

NOTE:

Better, but funds might be delegated to non-winners, which get wasted.

---v

### What is NPoS: Re-inventing the Wheel

**Multi-Delegation-POS**

Your stake is divided `1/n`th among N validators.

NOTE:

Same issue as before.

---v

### What is NPoS: Re-inventing the Wheel

**Nominated Proof of Stake**

You name up to `N` nominees, an arbitrary algorithm, computed either onchain or offchain decides the
winners and how to distribute the stake among them.

- ‚úÖ Can optimize other criteria other than "who had more votes"
- ‚úÖ Has a much higher chance to make sure staked tokens won't get wasted.

<br>

> NPoS is **approval-based, multi-winner election**.

## NPoS Protocol Overview

Assumptions:

Validators: those who wish to author blocks.
Nominators: Those who wish to support wanna-be authors.

Validation and nomination intentions can change, therefore we need periodic elections to always
choose the best validators + hold them slashable.

Ever election period is called an *Era*, consisting of 6 *sessions*.

---v

### NPoS Protocol Overview

THe current NPoS protocol revolves around an **election round**, which is itself made up of 4
episodes.

---v

### NPoS Protocol Overview


1. Validator + Nominator **Snapshot**

- Allows us to index stakers, not AccountIds.
- Allows us to not need to "freeze" the staking system.

---v

### NPoS Protocol Overview

2. Signed Phase

Any signed account can come up with a **NPoS solution** based on that snapshot. Deposits, rewards,
game theory, all that stuff.

---v

### NPoS Protocol Overview

3. Unsigned Phase

As the first backup, any validator can also submit a solution as a part of their block authoring.

---v

### NPoS Protocol Overview

4. Fallbacks

If all of the above fails, the chain won't rotate validators and the governance can either:

- dictate the next validator set
- trigger an onchain election (limited in what it can do)


---

## Why NPoS

1. Polkadot validators are the source of truth for the state transition of both the relay chain and
all of the parachains + bridges.

2. Polkadot validator are assigned to parachains, and swapped over time.

3. Polkadot validators all author the same number of blocks.

### Why NPoS: Election Score

```rust
pub struct ElectionScore {
  /// The minimal winner, in terms of total backing stake.
  ///
  /// This parameter should be maximized.
  pub minimal_stake: ExtendedBalance,
  /// The sum of the total backing of all winners.
  ///
  /// This parameter should maximized
  pub sum_stake: ExtendedBalance,
  /// The sum squared of the total backing of all winners, aka. the variance.
  ///
  /// Ths parameter should be minimized.
  pub sum_stake_squared: ExtendedBalance,
}
```
---v

### Why NPoS: Election Score

<br>

> NPoS allows us to incentivize the formation of a validator set that optimized the aforementioned `ElectionScore`.

## NPoS Drawbacks

- scalability.
- scalability.
- scalability.
- scalability.
- and scalability.

But we (strive to) get much better economic security measures in return.

And solve the scalability in the mid-term too ü§´

## NPoS Protocol: Proportional Representation:

Not strictly checked at the moment, but a core component in w3f's initial design to make NPoS what
it is now.

> Among all nominators $N$, if a minority $N^‚Ä≤$ has at least $t$ commonly trusted candidates, to whom it could "afford‚Äù to provide with an average support of at least $\frac{1}{n_{val}}$ $\sum_{n‚ààN} stake_n$, then this minority has a justified claim to be represented in $V$ by at least $t$ candidates.

---v

### NPoS Protocol: Proportional Representation

We initially chose an algorithm called `Sequential Phragmen`, which fulfills proportional justified
representation (**PJR**).

We have the code to do a PJR check, but it is not feasible to do onchain, and hasn't been a high
priority for us either.

---

## NPoS Future

- First, clean repay any technical debt, make everything ready for any further scaling.
- Infra for multi-block election
  - onchain
  - offchain
- Staking/Election parachain
- More (tax) friendly/configurable reward payout.
