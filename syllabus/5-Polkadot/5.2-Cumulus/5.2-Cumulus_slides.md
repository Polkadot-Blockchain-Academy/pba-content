- What Cumulus is and provides for you
- Extension to Substrate that makes substrate chains able to be used as parachains
- Substrate doesn't know what parachains are
- Most substrate is written generically for stand-alone blockchains; Cumulus gives you the tools to take a Substrate chain and convert it into a parachain

- What can you NOT use from Substrate if you use cumulus?
- What does Cumulus actually contain
- How do you create a parachain from scratch using cumulus?
- How can you convert a solo chain into a parachain?
