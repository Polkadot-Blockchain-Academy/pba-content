## Introduction to Polkadot

In this section, we will finally learn about Polkadot, its value proposition, how it works at a high level, and touch on all the key concepts you will expect to learn about throughout this module.

---

## What is Polkadot?

Polkadot is a heterogenous sharded multi-chain network.

---

## What is Polkadot Trying to Solve?

Polkadot attempts to solve 3 core problems with blockchains today:

1. Scalability
2. Interoperability
3. Shared Security

---

## The Value of Scalability

We need to create Web3 systems which support the needs of 8 billion people.

Blockchains will be a key part of the Web3 infrastructure.

---

## The Problem with Scalability

* Bitcoin: Limited Technology
* Ethereum:
* Other Single Chain Solutions
* Layer 2 Solutions

---

## Specificity Leads to Scalability

Systems which try to do everything will not do anything the best.

Generalized VMs like the EVM are not optimized

---

## The Problem with Interoperability

* Differences in fundamental protocols
	* Cryptography
	* Networking
	* Proofs
* Custom Bridges
