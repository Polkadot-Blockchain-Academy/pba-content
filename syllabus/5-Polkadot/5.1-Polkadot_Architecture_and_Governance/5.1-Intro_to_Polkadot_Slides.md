## Introduction to Polkadot

In this section, we will finally learn about Polkadot, its value proposition, how it works at a high level, and touch on all the key concepts you will expect to learn about throughout this module.

---

## What is Polkadot?

Polkadot is a scalable heterogenous sharded multi-chain network.

---

## What is Polkadot Trying to Solve?

Polkadot attempts to solve 3 core problems with blockchains today:

1. Scalability
2. Interoperability
3. Shared Security

---

## The Value of Scalability

We need to create Web3 systems which support the needs of 8 billion people.

Blockchains will be a key part of the Web3 infrastructure.

---

## The Problem with Scalability

* Bitcoin: Limited Technology
* Ethereum:
* Other Single Chain Solutions
* Layer 2 Solutions

---

## Specificity Leads to Scalability

Systems which try to do everything will not do anything the best.

Generalized VMs like the EVM are not optimized

---

## Examples

TODO: Examples of specificity? Transfers?

---

## The Value of Interoperability

TODO

---

## The Problem with Interoperability

* Differences in fundamental protocols
	* Cryptography
	* Networking
	* Proofs
* Custom Bridges

## The Value of Shared Security

## Relay Chain

The heart of Polkadot, responsible for the network’s shared security, consensus and cross-chain interoperability.

---

## Parachain

"Parallelized Chains" = Parachains

<img style="width: 500px;" src="../../../assets/img/5-Polkadot/icon-glossary-parachain.svg">

Sovereign blockchains that can have their own tokens and optimize their functionality for specific use cases.

---

## Parathreads

<img style="width: 500px;" src="../../../assets/img/5-Polkadot/icon-glossary-parathread.svg">

Similar to parachains but with a pay-as-you-go model. More economical for blockchains that don’t need continuous connectivity to the network.

---

## Bridges

<img style="width: 500px;" src="../../../assets/img/5-Polkadot/icon-glossary-bridge.svg">

Allow parachains and parathreads to connect and communicate with external networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin.

---

## The Components of Shared Security

---

## Nominated Proof of Stake

TODO

---

## Nominators

<img style="width: 500px;" src="../../../assets/img/5-Polkadot/icon-glossary-nominator.svg">

Allow parachains and parathreads to connect and communicate with external networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin.

---

## Validators

<img style="width: 500px;" src="../../../assets/img/5-Polkadot/icon-glossary-validator.svg">

Secure the relay chain by staking dots, validating proofs from collators and participating in consensus with other validators.

---

## Collators

<img style="width: 500px;" src="../../../assets/img/5-Polkadot/icon-glossary-collator.svg">

Maintain shards by collecting shard transactions from users and producing proofs for validator.

## Polkadot Validation Function (PVF)

Validators can verify the state transition of any Parachain given 3 simple pieces of data:

* The Parachain's Wasm Runtime
* The Parachain's Block
* The Parachain's State Proof (Proof of Validity)

---

## Mechanics of Parachain Validation

Imagine:

* 10,000 Validators
* 100 Parachains
* 100 Validators per Parachain
* Random Assignment of Validators
* Equivocation Reporting

## Economics of Polkadot

The DOT token has 3 core utilities:

* Governance
* Staking
* Bonding

---

## Governance

Polkadot token holders have complete control over the protocol. All privileges, which on other platforms are exclusive to miners, will be given to the Relay Chain participants (DOT holders), including managing exceptional events such as protocol upgrades and fixes.

---

## Staking

Game theory incentivizes token holders to behave in honest ways. Good actors are rewarded by this mechanism whilst bad actors will lose their stake in the network. This ensures the network stays secure.

---

## Bonding
New parachains are added by bonding tokens. Outdated or non-useful parachains are removed by removing bonded tokens. This is a form of proof of stake.
