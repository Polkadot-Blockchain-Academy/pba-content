# Lesson Plan

This lesson plan covers the combination of lectures, activites, and sections of the accompanying
exercises to assign to students at what time. As there is a large amount of variance in student
experience around cryptography, we want to make sure that we have a variety of content for students
of different experience levels.

The 'Assign `px`' sections mean that students should start working on the graded assignments for
that section. There should be some time allocated to students to work on that, as well as optional
sections from previous parts. The "assignment" is almost closer to telling students they have enough
context to complete those parts.
