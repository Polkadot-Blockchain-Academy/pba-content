# Lesson 4: Other Exotic Primitives

## Why is this topic Important?

Blockchains use more cutting edge (and untested!) cryptography than other applications.
They use these primitives for privacy, consensus and scaling.

## Learning Outcome

By the end of this lesson, learners should know what the most common exotic primitives used in blockchain are and know a little about each.

## Learning Objectives

## Core Ideas to Convey

1. VRFs
1. Erasure Coding
1. ZK Proofs

## Activities and Exercises

Suggestion:

Infinite deck poker or just some simplified "poker" with VRFs - We'd have to build up the complexity and initially drastically simplify the rules.
Simplest case is person with highest number wins, but can still do bidding, calling etc.
