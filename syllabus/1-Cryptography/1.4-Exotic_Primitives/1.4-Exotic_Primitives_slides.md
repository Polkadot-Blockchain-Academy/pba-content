### Outline

<!--
You can reference slides within this presentation like [this other slide](#at-the-end-of-this-lecture-you-will-be-able-to) by use of the header title.

Please make your lecture precise.

- Limit the main points in a lecture to five or fewer.
- Create effective visuals, analogies, demonstrations, and examples to reinforce the main points.
  {TAs and the Parity design team can assist! Please let us know marking an item here as `TODO`}
- Emphasize your objectives and key points in the beginning, as you get to them, and as a summary at the end.

## Ring Signatures

A type of digital signature where a ring is a set of users:

- Each user in the set have their own public/private key pairs
- Each user can use their private key to sign under the "ring's"/set's identity
- Signatures can be verified against the sets public keys (together)
- A recipient will not be able to determine who the exact sender is 
- Used mainly for anonymity, privacy via hiding in the crowd

## Multi-party Computation (MPC)

MPC is a field of cryptography which allows for the following

- Multiple parties, each having their own private input
- The goal is to compute a function over their inputs, while keeping all inputs private
- Example: Yao's Millionaire's problem, 2 millionaires want to figure out who is the richest without revealing their individual wealth, can be generalized to >2
- Example: Multiple hospitals want to train a machine learning model on sensitive patient data
- Input Privacy: Only the final result is revealed and nothing else
- Correctness: An adversarial party should not be able to prevent other parties from receiving their correct outputs

## MPC applications for Blockchains

Multi-sigs, Threshold signatures etc. are all examples of MPC:

- Multiple parties compute a function (the signature) using their private inputs (private keys) while preserving privacy of their inputs
- Committee-based consensus/governance: A committee of validators can approve transactions/proposals using just one signature
- Protecting wallets: Private keys can be split into multiple "shares" using a concept called secret sharing and stored in different locations safely, recombine shares to use keys
- Secure file sharing: Files can be split into shares and kept on different user devices, access to a few shares never reveals content of the files, combining a lot of shares allows file reconstruction

## Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Proofs

A versatile tool for the era of privacy:

- A ZK proof involves 2 parties, a prover and a verifier
- The prover wants to convince the verifier that a statement is true 
- For example, a prover wants to prove to a verifier that they have more than $x$ amount in their bank account
- But the prover wants to preserve privacy, and not reveal how much money exactly they have
- Prove a statement is true, without revealing any other information

## ZK applications for Blockchains

Recently, there has been an explosion in ZK applications for Blockchains:

- It all started with transaction privacy: hide the identity of the sender and receiver from everyone
- Think blockchain, but a completely private transaction log
- Proofs of membership: prove you are a member of an exclusive group (ex. APE NFT owners), without revealing any other detail (which APE you own)
- Off-chain computation, on-chain receipt/Rollups: a local group of user's transact off-chain locally for a day and just commit a proof of change in balances of user's at the end of the day to the blockchain
- Not just privacy, but also efficieny: Proofs are small, fast to verify but can condense a lot of information such as: the final balance after a day of transaction for millions of users
