Think of a real world non blockchain problem that you think can be solved with the cryptographic concepts learned in this course.

1. Explain the problem
2. Explain why it should be solved with cryptography, a.k.a. which properties mentioned are you trying to ensure
3. Use the APIs provided and your coding skills to write a rust prototype of your use case

Grading:
Mandatory: Focus on one specific instance of the problem and show it's explicit solution
Extra: generalize your solution to something as close to an automation as you can develop
Number of properties ensured is multiplicative to your grade.
Example:
-- Suppose the basic route means 10 points and the extra route +5 points.
If you ensure 2 properties on the mandatory route you get 2*10 = 20 points
mandatory AND extra routes you get 2*10 + 2\*5 = 20 + 10 = 30 points
Items 1 and 2 should be written in your project's README.md whatever route you choose
