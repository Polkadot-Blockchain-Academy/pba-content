## Digital signatures used in Web3

<!-- TODO: list and define all web3 relevant ones -->
- Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm ([ECDSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm))
    - Keccaak-256 used in Ethereum ([explainer](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/3542/how-are-ethereum-addresses-generated))

## Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA)

- Uses a variant of Schnorr signature based on twisted Edwards curves.
- Designed to be faster & secure

[Reference Ed25519 implementation](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/software.html) is Public domain software.

## ECDSA vs EdDSA

- EdDSA is simpler than ECDSA, easier to understand and to implement
- Similar security strength for curves with similar key lengths
- EdDSA algorithm is typically faster than ECDSA
- _EdDSA signatures do not provide a way to recover the signer's public key from the signature and the message._ 

Generally, it is considered that EdDSA is recommended for most modern apps.

Notes:
We use a variant of Ed25519 as the default in Substrate chains: sr25519.
This well be the one we discuss most and will use in the academy.
