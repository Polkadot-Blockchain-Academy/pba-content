# Digital Signatures
## Basics

*Lecture 2, Module 1*

---

### Signature API

<br>

<widget-text>

Signature libraries should generally all expose some basic functions:

- `fn generate_key(r) -> sk;`: Generate a secret key `sk` from some input `r`. The input could be anything, for example the movement pattern of a mouse.
- `fn public_key(sk) -> pk;`: Return the public key from a given secret key.
- `fn sign(sk, msg) -> signature;`: Takes as input the secret key and a message; returns a digital signature.
- `fn verify(pk, msg, signature) -> bool;`: Takes as input a public key, a message, and a signature; returns whether the signature is valid on the given inputs.

---

### Rust Demo - Key Generation and Signing

Let's do a demonstration in Rust to:

<widget-text center>

1. Generate a secret key
1. Sign a message
1. Verify the signature
1. Attempt to alter the message

Note:
See the Jupyter notebook for this lecture.

---

### Hash Functions

<br>

There are two lectures dedicated to hash functions. But they are used as part of all signing processes.

For now, we only concern ourselves with using Blake2.

---

### Hashed Messages

<br>

As mentioned in the introduction, it's often more practical to sign the hash of a message. 

<widget-text center>

Therefore, the sign/verify API may be *used* like:

<br>

- `fn sign(sk, H(msg)) -> signature;`
- `fn verify(pk, H(msg), signature) -> bool;`
</widget-text>

<br>

Where `H` is a hash function (for our purposes, Blake2). This means the verifier will need to run the correct hash function on the message.

---

### Rust Demo - Hashing a Message

Back to Rust to:

<widget-text center>

1. Use a longer message
1. Hash it
1. Verify the signature on the hash

Note:
See the Jupyter notebook for this lecture.

---

### Signing Payloads

<br>

Signing payloads are an important part of system design. Users should have credible expectations about how their messages are used.

For example, when a user authorises a transfer, they almost always mean just one time.

---

### Replay Attacks

<br>

Replay attacks occur when someone intercepts and resends a valid message. The receiver will carry out the instructions since the message contains a valid signature.

<widget-text center>

- Since we assume that channels are insecure, all messages should be considered intercepted.
- The "receiver", for blockchain purposes, is actually an automated system.

---

### Replay Attack Prevention

<br>

Signing payloads should be designed so that they can only be used one time and in one context. Examples:

<widget-text center>

- Monotonically increasing account nonces
- Timestamps (or previous blocks)
- Context identifiers like genesis hash and spec versions

## Signature Schemes

---

### ECDSA

<br>

- Uses Secp256k1 elliptic curve.
- ECDSA (used initially in Bitcoin/Ethereum) was developed to work around the patent on Schnorr signatures.
- ECDSA complicates more advanced cryptographic techniques, like threshold signatures.

---

### Ed25519

<br>

- Schnorr signature designed to reduce mistakes in implementation and usage in classical applications, like TLS certificates.
- Signing is 20-30x faster than ECDSA signatures.

---

### Sr25519

<br>

Sr25519 addresses several small risk factors that emerged from Ed25519 usage by blockchains.

---

### Use in Substrate

<br>

- Sr25519 is the default key type in most Substrate-based applications.
- Its public key is 32 bytes and generally used to identify key holders (likewise for ed25519).
- Secp256k1 public keys are _33_ bytes, so their _hash_ is used to represent their holders.

### HDKD

Hierarchical Deterministic Key Derivation

---

### Hard vs. Soft

<br>

Key derivation allows one to derive (virtually limitless) child keys from one "parent".

<br>

Derivations can either be "hard" or "soft".

---

### Hard Derivation

<br>

Hard derivation requires the secret key and derives new children secret keys.

<br>

Typical "operational security" usages should favor hard derivation over soft derivation because hard derivations avoid leaking the sibling keys, unless the original secret is compromized.

---

### Hard Derivation in Wallets

<br>

Wallets can derive keys for use in different consensus systems while only needing to back up one secret plus a pattern for child derivation.

<widget-image src="/assets/img/1-Cryptography/Hard Derivation in Wallets.png"></widget-image>

---

Let's imagine we want to use this key on multiple networks, but we don't want the public keys to be connected to each other.

---
### Rust Demo - Hard Derivation

Back to Rust to derive new keys. 

<br>

*Note that these derivations create entirely new secret seeds.*

Note:
See the Jupyter notebook for this lecture.

---

### Soft Derivation

<br>

Soft derivation allows one to create derived addresses from only the public key. Contrary to hard derivation, all addresses have related or effectively the same private key.

Note: 
Soft derivations can break some niche advanced protocols, but our sr25519 crate avoids supporting protocols that conflict with soft derivations.

---

### Soft Derivation in Wallets

<br>

Wallets can use soft derivation to link all payments controlled by a single private key, without the need to expose the private key for the address derivation.

<br>

---------------

<widget-text>

**Use case:** *A business wants to generate a new address for each payment, but should be able to automatically give customers an address without the secret key owner deriving a new child.*

Note:
See: https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-accounts#soft-vs-hard-derivation

---

### Rust Demo - Soft Derivation

Let's go back to Rust to soft derive more children.

<br>

<widget-text center>

* Note that these generate new addresses, but use the same secret seed.

* We can also use the same paths, but only using the Account ID from `//polkadot`. It generates the same addresses!

Note:
See the Jupyter notebook for this lecture.

## Mnemonics and Seed Creation

---

### Mnemonics

<br>

Many wallets use a dictionary of words and give people phrases, often 12 or 24 words, as these are easier to back up/recover than byte arrays.

<br>

Some people create their own phrases. This is usually stupid.

---

### Dictionaries

<br>

<widget-columns>
<widget-column>
There are some standard dictionaries to define which words (and character sets) are included in the generation of a phrase. Substrate uses the dictionary from BIP39.
</widget-column>

<widget-column>


| No.  |   word   |   
|------|----------|
|    1 | abandon  |
|    2 | ability  |
|    3 | able     |
|    4 | about    |
|    5 | above    |

<widget-text style="font-size: .8em;">

</widget-column>
</widget-columns>

---

### Mnemonic to Secret Key

<br>

Of course, the secret key is a point on an elliptic curve, not a phrase.

BIP39 applies 2,048 rounds of the SHA-512 hash function to the mnemonic to derive a 64 byte key.

<br>

Substrate uses the entropy byte array from the mnemonic.

---

### Portability

<br>

Different key derivation functions affect the ability to use the same mnemonic in multiple wallets.
