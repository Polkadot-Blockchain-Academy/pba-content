### Outline

<!--
You can reference slides within this presentation like [this other slide](#at-the-end-of-this-lecture-you-will-be-able-to) by use of the header title.

Please make your lecture precise.

- Limit the main points in a lecture to five or fewer.
- Create effective visuals, analogies, demonstrations, and examples to reinforce the main points.
  {TAs and the Parity design team can assist! Please let us know marking an item here as `TODO`}
- Emphasize your objectives and key points in the beginning, as you get to them, and as a summary at the end.

### _At the end of this lecture, you will be able to:_

- Define the most common cryptographic primitives
- Explain what primitives are used in Web3 applications and why
- Summarize the evaluation criteria used to select a sound cryptographic implementation

## Pre-requisites

No background in math or cryptography is necessary.

Notes:
College level mathematical maturity in algebra and probability is helpful.

## Digital signatures used in Web3

<!-- TODO: list and define all web3 relevant ones -->

- Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm ([ECDSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm))
  - Keccaak-256 used in Ethereum ([explainer](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/3542/how-are-ethereum-addresses-generated))

---

## Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA)

- Uses a variant of Schnorr signature based on twisted Edwards curves.
- Designed to be faster & secure

[Reference Ed25519 implementation](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/software.html) is Public domain software.

---

## ECDSA vs EdDSA

- EdDSA is simpler than ECDSA, easier to understand and to implement
- Similar security strength for curves with similar key lengths
- EdDSA algorithm is typically faster than ECDSA
- _EdDSA signatures do not provide a way to recover the signer's public key from the signature and the message._

Generally, it is considered that EdDSA is recommended for most modern apps.

Notes:
We use a variant of Ed25519 as the default in Substrate chains: sr25519.
This well be the one we discuss most and will use in the academy.
