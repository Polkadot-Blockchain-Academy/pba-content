## Manual Public Key Encryption

This activity introduces students to the idea of asymetric encryption through a hands on encryption and decryption activity done on paper.
The crypto system is based on graph partitioning, and extracting the private key from the public is equivalent to partitioning a graph such that each partition has a hub node connected to all others.

The activity is cribbed from two CS Unplugged activities:
The same graph crypto activity: https://classic.csunplugged.org/documents/activities/public-key-encryption/unplugged-18-public_key_encryption_0.pdf
The foundational graph activity: https://classic.csunplugged.org/documents/activities/dominating-sets/unpluggedTeachersSupplement2012-draft-v1-dominatingSets.pdf

Each student creates a private key by creating a pre-partitioned graph, and highlighting hub nodes, then adding additional edges connecting the partitions to disguise the partitioning.
Then a single number is encrypted and passed to the partner for decrypting.

The specifics are in the PDF.
