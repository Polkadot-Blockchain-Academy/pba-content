### Outline

<!--
You can reference slides within this presentation like [this other slide](#at-the-end-of-this-lecture-you-will-be-able-to) by use of the header title.

Please make your lecture precise.

- Limit the main points in a lecture to five or fewer.
- Create effective visuals, analogies, demonstrations, and examples to reinforce the main points.
  {TAs and the Parity design team can assist! Please let us know marking an item here as `TODO`}
- Emphasize your objectives and key points in the beginning, as you get to them, and as a summary at the end.

## The power of elliptic curves

What are the different types of signature schemes utilized by blockchains today, mostly ECDSA based:

- Elliptic curve mathematics allows one to perform operations on a mathematical object: and elliptic curve (add graphic)
- Why elliptic curves? 
- With elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), the size of the keys to achieve the same level of security is much lower than RSA-based cryptography (another popular cryptographic assumption)
- Therefore, ECC: High security, short keys, fast operations
- As an example, using OpenSSL, for the same level of security ECDSA keys are 256-bits compared to 2048-bit RSA keys
- Time to sign for ECDSA: 20x faster

## Various curves and signatures in Blockchains

These are the different curves and signature schemes used today:

- Curve: secp256k1 , ECDSA signatues (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cosmos etc.)
- secp256k1 was chosen for efficient implementation first by Satoshi
- Curve: ed25519, EdDSA signatures (Solana, ZCash etc.)
- EdDSA does not need a random (unpredictable) string for each signature, unlike ECDSA
- ECDSA: The random strings/numbers used for each signature should be kept secret and never repeated, else secret key can be recovered
- BLS signatures are another type of signatures, efficient but also need an extra, slightly expensive ingredient "pairing functions"

## Multi-sigs

Multi-sigs, short form for Multi-signatures allow multiple parties to authorize activity (transactions etc.)

- Each party has their own key
- Signature on the same message is needed from the different parties to authorize activity
- Why Multi-sigs?
- Joint accounts: multiple parties can control one pool of funds together
- Increasing security: when private keys to spend from a wallet are spread across multiple machines, you get more security
- $m$-of-$n$ multi-sigs allow authorization with $m$ out of total $n$ keys

## Schnorr Signatures and Key-aggregation

Schnorr signatures also use elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC):

- Most importantly Schnorr signatures allow for Key Aggregation
- Key aggregation: multiple parties can combine their public keys
- First the three parties combine their public keys, to form a single combined public key (used for verification)
- Then each party signs the same message
- In the end, all the signatures from different parties, on the same message are combined: to just 1 signature
- Great on-chain storage efficiency, verification efficiency

## Signatures in Substrate


---

## Threshold Signatures

If "atleast" $t$ out of total $n$ parties approve, signature is generated

- Runs an interactive protocol among multiple parties for generating keys and signing
- Signer information folded into 1 signature
- No need to know who signed, as long as threshold of parties sign
- Efficent: can sign off-chain and communicate the information on-chain
- The blockchain does not need to know the exact signer information
- Allows for committee based, privacy-preserving protocols: as long as a threshold of votes received, signnature is generated
