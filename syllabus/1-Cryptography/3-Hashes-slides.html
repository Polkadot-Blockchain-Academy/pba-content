# Hash Functions
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Introduction

We often want a succinct representation of some data<br />with the expectation that we are referring to the same data.

##### A "fingerprint"
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Hash Function Properties


- Accept unbounded size input <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->
- Map to a bounded output <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Be fast to compute <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Be computable strictly one-way<br />(difficult to find a pre-image for a hash) <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- Resist pre-image attacks<br />(attacker controls one input) <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
- Second pre-image resistance: Given an input and output<br />(resisting second pre-image attacks). <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->
- Resist collisions<br />(attacker controls both inputs) <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6" -->

<aside class="notes"><ol>
<li>one way meaning for a given output difficult to get the input</li>
<li>attacker has the value 5 and from that can find a preimage that hashes to 5 (5 just an example value)</li>
<li>attacker has input and output and cant find a another input which maps to the output</li>
<li>More generally the attacker has the entire input space and cant find two inputs which hash to the same value</li>
</ol>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Hash Function API

A hash function should:

- Accept an unbounded input size (`[u8]` byte array)
- Return a fixed-length output (here, a 32 byte array).

```rust
fn hash(s: &[u8]) -> [u8; 32];
```
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Example

**Short input (5 bytes):**

```text
hash('hello') =
 0x1c8aff950685c2ed4bc3174f3472287b56d9517b9c948127319a09a7a36deac8
```

**Large input (1.2 MB):**

```text
hash(Harry_Potter_series_as_string) u
 0xc4d194054f03dc7155ccb080f1e6d8519d9d6a83e916960de973c93231aca8f4
```
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Input Sensitivity

Changing even 1 bit of a hash function _completely_ scrambles the output.

```text
hash('hello') =
 0x1c8aff950685c2ed4bc3174f3472287b56d9517b9c948127319a09a7a36deac8
```

```text
hash('hellp') =
 0x7bc9c272894216442e0ad9df694c50b6a0e12f6f4b3d9267904239c63a7a0807

## Speed

- Some hash functions are designed to be slow. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->
- Does anyone know why someone would want a hash function to be slow? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- These have applications like password hashing, which would slow down brute-force attackers. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" --> 
- For our purposes, we generally want them to be fast. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

## Famous Hash Algorithms

<pba-flex center>

- xxHash a.k.a TwoX (non-cryptographic)
- MD5
- SHA1
- RIPEMD-160
- SHA2-256 (aka SHA256) &c.
- SHA3
- Keccak
- Blake2

xxHash64 is about 20x faster than Blake2.

## Hash Functions in Blockchains

<pba-flex center>

- Bitcoin: SHA2-256 & RIPMD-160

## Non-Cryptographic Hash Functions

Non-cryptographic hash functions provide weaker<br />guarantees in exchange for performance.

They are OK to use when you know that the input is not malicious.

**If in doubt, use a cryptographic hash function.**
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## One Way

Given a hash, it should be difficult to find an input value (pre-image)<br />that would produce the given hash.

That is, given `H(x)`, it should be difficult to find `x`.

<aside class="notes"><p>We sometimes add random bytes to pre-images to prevent guesses based on context (e.g., if you are hashing &quot;rock, paper, scissors&quot;, then finding a pre-image is trivial without some added randomness.)</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Second Pre-Image Attacks

Given a hash and a pre-image, it should be difficult to find _another_<br />pre-image that would produce the same hash.

Given `H(x)`, it should be difficult to find any `x'`

such that `H(x) == H(x')`.

<aside class="notes"><p>Since most signature schemes perform some internal hashing, this second pre-image would also pass signature verification.</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Collision Resistance

It should be difficult for someone to find two messages that<br />hash to the same value.

It should be difficult to find an `x` and `y`

such that `H(x) == H(y)`.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Collision Resistance

**Difference from second pre-image attack:**

In a second pre-image attack, the attacker only controls one input.

In a collision, the attacker controls both inputs.

They may attempt to trick someone into signing one message.

<aside class="notes"><p>Attacker has intention to impersonate the signer with the other. Generally speaking, even finding a
single hash collision often results in the hash function being considered unsafe.</p>

## Birthday Problem

<pba-col style="font-size:smaller">

> With 23 people, there is a 6% chance that someone will be born on a specific date, but a 50% chance that two share a birthday.

- Must compare each birthday with every other, not with a single one.<br /> <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->
- Number of possible "hits" increases exponentially for more attempts, reducing the expected success to the square-root of what a specific target would be. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

</pba-cols>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Birthday Attack

Thus, with a birthday attack, it is possible to find a collision of a hash function in $\sqrt {2^{n}}=2^{^{\frac{n}{2}}}$, with $\cdot 2^{^{\frac{n}{2}}}$ being the classical preimage resistance security.

So, hash function security is only half of the bit space.

<aside class="notes"><p>e.g., a 256 bit hash output yields 2^128 security</p>

</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Partial Resistance

It should be difficult for someone to partially (for a substring of the hash output) find a collision or "second" pre-image.

- Bitcoin PoW is a partial pre-image attack. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->
- Can anyone explain how? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" --> 
- Prefix/suffix pre-image attack resistance reduces opportunity for UI attacks for address spoofing.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Prefix collision resistance important to rationalize costs for some cryptographic data structures.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

<aside class="notes"><p>This is a technique used to trick users into thinking they are interacting with a trusted entity (like a account or piece of data) when they are actually interacting with a malicious actor. This can be done by creating a fraudulent address that looks similar to a legitimate one.
example AEVXZ AEVYZ</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Hash Function Selection

<pba-flex center>

When users (i.e. attackers) have control of the input, cryptographic hash functions must be used.

When input is not controllable (e.g. a system-assigned index), a non-cryptographic hash function can be used and is faster.

<aside class="notes"><p>Only safe when the users cannot select the pre-image, e.g. a system-assigned index.</p>

# Applications
</script></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Cryptographic Guarantees

Let's see which cryptographic properties apply to hashes.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Confidentiality

- Sending or publicly posting a hash of some data $D$ keeps $D$ confidential, as only those who already knew $D$ recognize $H(D)$ as representing $D$.
- Both cryptographic and non-cryptographic hashes work for this, _only if the input space is large enough_.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Confidentiality Bad Example

Imagine playing rock, paper, scissors by posting hashes and then revealing. However, if the message is either "rock", "paper", or "scissors", the output will always be either:

```text
hash('rock') = 0x10977e4d68108d418408bc9310b60fc6d0a750c63ccef42cfb0ead23ab73d102
hash('paper') = 0xea923ca2cdda6b54f4fb2bf6a063e5a59a6369ca4c4ae2c4ce02a147b3036a21
hash('scissors') = 0x389a2d4e358d901bfdf22245f32b4b0a401cc16a4b92155a2ee5da98273dad9a
```

The other player doesn't need to undo the hash function to know what you played!

<aside class="notes"><p>Question:
How can we fix this issue?</p>
<p>The data space has to be <em>sufficiently large</em>.
Adding some randomness to input of the hash fixes this. Add x bits of randomness to make it x bits of security on that hash.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Authenticity

Anyone can make a hash, so hashes provide no authenticity guarantees.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Integrity

A hash changes if the data changes, so it does provide integrity.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Non-Repudiation

Hashes on their own cannot provide authenticity, and as such cannot provide non-repudiation.

However, if used in another cryptographic primitive that _does_ provide non-repudiation, $H(D)$ provides the same non-repudation as $D$ itself.

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>The hash alone doesnt give one the ability to authenticate or identify the originator of the data because anyone with access to the data can produce the same hash.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is key in digital signatures. However, it&#39;s important to realize that if $D$ is kept secret, $H(D)$ is basically meaningless.</p>
</aside></script></section></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Content-Derived Indexing

Hash functions can be used to generate deterministic<br />and unique lookup keys for databases.

<aside class="notes"><p>Given some fixed property, like an ID and other metadata the user knows beforehand, they can always find the database entry with all of the content they are looking for.</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Data Integrity Checks

Members of a peer-to-peer network may host and share<br />file chunks rather than large files.

In [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent), each file chunk is hash identified so peers can<br /> _request and verify_ the chunk is a member of the larger,<br /> _content addressed_ file.

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li><p>Content addressed file is when a file is identified based on the content of the file. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The hash of the large file can also serve as a signal to the protocol that transmission is complete.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Account Abstractions

Public keys can be used to authorize actions by signing of instructions.

The properties of hash functions allow other kinds of representations.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Public Key Representation

Because hashes serve as unique representations of other data,<br />that other data could include public keys.<br />
A system can map a plurality of key sizes to a fixed length<br />(e.g. for use as a database key).

For example, the ECDSA public key is 33 bytes:

```text
Public key (hex):
  0x02d82cdc83a966aaabf660c4496021918466e61455d2bc403c34bde8148b227d7a

Hash of pub key:
  0x8fea32b38ed87b4739378aa48f73ea5d0333b973ee72c5cb7578b143f82cf7e9
                                                                    ^^
```
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Commitment Schemes

It is often useful to commit to some information<br /> without storing or revealing it:

- A prediction market would want to reveal predictions only after the confirming/refuting event occurred.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->
- Users of a system may want to discuss proposals without storing the proposal on the system.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- However, participants should not be able to modify their predictions or proposals.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

<aside class="notes"><p>What is an example of an application would use an application like this?</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Commit-Reveal

<pba-flex center>

1. Share a hash of data as a commitment ($c$)
1. Reveal the data itself ($d$)

<pba-flex>

It is normal to add some randomness to the message<br />to expand the input set size:

$$ hash(message + randomness) => commitment $$

<pba-flex style="font-size: smaller;">

Commitment: `0x97c9b8d5019e51b227b7a13cd2c753cae2df9d3b435e4122787aff968e666b0b`
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Reveal

Message with some added randomness:

<pba-flex style="font-size: smaller;">

> "I predict Boris Johnson will resign on 7 July 2022. facc8d3303c61ec1808f00ba612c680f"
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Data Identifiers

Sometimes people want to store information in one place and reference it in another. For reference, they need some "fingerprint" or digest.

As an example, they may vote on executing some privileged instructions within the system.

The hash of the information can succinctly represent the information and commit its creator to not altering it.

## Data Structures (in Brief)

This is the focus of a later lesson.

<aside class="notes"><p>For now, just a brief introduction.</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Pointer-Based Linked Lists

Pointer-based linked lists are a foundation of programming.

But pointers are independent from the data they reference,<br />so the data can be modified while maintaining the list.

That is, pointer-based linked lists are not tamper evident.

<img src="./img/Hash-Chains.png" />
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Hash-Based Linked Lists

Hash-based lists make the reference related to the data they are referencing.<br />
The properties of hash functions make them a good choice for this application.

Any change at any point in the list would create downstream changes to all hashes.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Merkle Trees

<aside class="notes"><p>Each leaf is the hash of some data object and each node is the hash of its children.</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Proofs

Merkle trees allow many proofs relevant to the rest of this course,<br />e.g. that some data object is a member of the tree<br />without passing the entire tree.

## Hash Examples in Substrate

**Sr25519 Signatures**

Sr25519 hashes the message as part of its signing process.

**Transactions**

In transactions in Substrate, key holders sign a<br /> _hash of the instructions_ when the instructions<br />are longer than 256 bytes.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Database Keys

**TwoX64** is safe to use when users (read: attackers)<br />cannot control the input, e.g. when a<br />database key is a system-assigned index.

**Blake2** should be used for everything else.

_Again, there is a whole lesson on hash-based data structures._
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Other Uses of Hashes in Substrate

Hashes are also used for:

<pba-flex center>

- Generating multisig accounts
- Generating system-controlled accounts
- Generating proxy-controlled accounts
- Representing proposals
- Representing claims (e.g. the asset trap)
