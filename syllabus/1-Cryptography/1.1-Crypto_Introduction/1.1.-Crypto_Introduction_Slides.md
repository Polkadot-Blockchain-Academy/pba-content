## Operating Context

**The internet is a public space.**

</widget-column>

<widget-text>

People and organizations communicate over public channels. There exist adversaries who may want to:
- Read messages not intended for them
- Impersonate others
- Tamper with messages

</widget-text>
</widget-columns>

Notes:
Some examples include:
- An attacker may impersonate your boss, trying to get you to send them money
- An attacker may change instructions, e.g. 100 EUR transfer to 10000 EUR

Probably best for the teacher to ask students to participate with examples of application messages,
not just person-to-person messages.

<widget-column white>

## Operating Context

**Many resources are constrained.**

</widget-column>

<widget-text>

- **Network, storage, computation, etc.**: We don't want to send, store, or operate on the same data, but we want guarantees about it, e.g. that we agree on a message's contents.
- **Privacy**: We must assume that all channels can be monitored, and thus closed channels are heavily constrained (i.e. assumed to not exist).

---

## Open vs. Closed Channels

**Cryptography based on public systems is more sound anyway.**

<br>

**Kerckhoff's Principle:** Security should not rely on secret _methods_, but rather on secret _information_.

Notes:
- Methods can be reverse engineered. After that, the communication channel is completely insecure. For example, CSS protection for DVDs.
- We always work with public, open protocols.

---

## Cryptographic Guarantees

<widget-text>

**Cryptography provides methods for communicating securely in the open.**

**Encryption is just one use of cryptography. It also provides other powerful guarantees.**

<widget-text center>

- Data accessibility (encryption)
- Message authenticity
- Data integrity
- Nonrepudiation (later)
</widget-text>


---

### Data Accessibility

A party may gain access to some information (the "plaintext") if and only if they know some secret (a key).


Note:
The ability to decrypt some data and reveal its underlying information directly implies knowledge of some secret, potentially unknown to the originator of the information. Supplying the original information (aka plain text message) can be used in a "challenge game" mechanism as one means of proving knowledge of the secret without compromising it.

---

### Message Authenticity

Like physical signatures, cryptography may be used to give a reasonable expectation of a message's provenance (origin), in order to give the users the credible expectation that the stated origin is authentic.

Note:
- Digital signatures should be difficult (practically speaking: impossible) to forge.
- Digital signatures should verify that the signer knows some secret, without revealing the secret itself.

---

### Data Integrity

Physical signatures provide weak authenticity guarantees (i.e. they are quite easy to forge), and no integrity guarantees. 

---

For example, if you change the year on your university diploma, the dean's signature is still valid. Digital signatures provide a guarantee that the signed information has not been tampered with.

### Symmetric Cryptography

<widget-image src="/assets/img/1-Cryptography/Symmetric Cryptography.png"></widget-image>

Example: AES, XOR cipher

---

### Symmetric Cryptography Example: XOR Cipher

<widget-columns>
<widget-column>
<br>
Very simple cipher where the encryption and decryption functions are identical.

A plaintext can be converted to ciphertext, and vice versa, by applying a bitwise XOR operation with a key known to both parties.

</widget-column>
<widget-column>

```text
Plain: 1010  -->Cipher: 0110
Key:   1100  |          1100
       ----  |          ----
       0110--^          1010
```

</widget-column>
</widget-columns>

---

### Symmetric Cryptography

<br>

We typically expect symmetric cryptography to preserve little about the original plaintext. We caution however that constructing these protocols remains delicate, even given secure primitives, with two classical examples being unsalted passwords and the [ECB penguin](https://tonybox.net/posts/ecb-penguin/).

---
## One-Way Functions

One-way functions form the basis of **asymmetric cryptography**.

<br>

<widget-text center>

- Functions for which we know fast algorithms to compute
- But for which we believe to be hard to invert without the knowledge of some secret.
</widget-text>

Note:
There are a lot of assumptions about why these functions are hard to invert, but we cannot rigorously prove it. We often express inversion problems in terms of mathematical games or oracles.

---

### Asymmetric Cryptography

<br>

<widget-text center>

* In asymmetric cryptography, we pass secrets through functions that preserve algebraic properties of the secret, but yield a public counterpart to the secret.

* This counterpart (the "public key") is strictly derivable from the other (the secret), without revealing any information about the secret.

* Using only the public key, information can be encrypted such that only those with knowledge of the secret can access it.
</widget-text>

---

### Asymmetric Protocols

<br> 

<widget-text center>

- Asymmetric cryptography includes RSA, Elgamal, Elliptic Curve (slowest to fastest)
- Elliptic Curves (ECC) used in Polkadot/Substrate:
  - secp256k1/ecdsa
  - sr25519
  - ed25519
- ECC requires double the bits to the symmetric AES for the same level of security. E.g. 128 bit security requires a 256 bit ECC key.
</widget-text>

Note:
Discuss misuse resistance and motivation for support here. Or could be in more runtime focused lesson?
- ECDSA: Lots of footguns, but we support for legacy Ethereum compatibility
- Ed25519: Some misuse / insecure libraries, e.g. https://twitter.com/kostascrypto/status/1537245592019054593
- Sr25519: Reduces misuse risks, but mainly has adoption in Substrate ecosystem

---

### Practical Considerations

<br>

<widget-text>

**Symmetric cryptography** is much faster, but requires more setup (key establishment) and trust (someone else knows the secret).
</widget-text>

<widget-text>

**Asymmetric cryptography** is slow, but typically preserves specific algebraic relationships, which then permit more diverse if fragile protocols.
</widget-text>

---

## Hybrid Cryptography 

Hybrid cryptography mixes symmetric and asymmetric cryptography. 

<widget-text center>

- Symmetric encryption can provide speed, and often confidentiality,
- And asymmetric can dictate relations among the participants.
</widget-text>

---

### Commutative En-/Decryption

<br>

In a commutative structure, a message may be encrypted/decrypted multiple times with potentially multiple keys.

<br>

The output does not depend on the order of operations.

---

---

### Commutative En-/Decryption

<br> 

Encrypting a message with key $A$, and then encrypting the ciphertext with key $B$, would result in the same ciphertext had one encrypted with $B$ and then $A$.

<br>

\begin{align}
M &=> E_A(E_B(M)) == E_B(E_A(M)) => C \\\\
C &=> D_A(D_B(C)) == D_B(D_A(C)) \ => M
\end{align}

<br>

Elliptic curve cryptography is based on *commutative* algebraic structures.

---

## Digital Signatures

**Digital signatures provide message authenticity and integrity guarantees.**

<br>

*The next two lectures are dedicated to digital signatures, this is strictly an intro.*

---

### Digital Signatures

<br>

A *signing function* is a pure function which operates on some *message data* (which may or may not be small, depending on the function) and some *secret* (a small piece of information known only to the operator). The result of this function is a small piece of data called a *signature*.

<br>

It has a special property: it proves (beyond reasonable doubt) that the signer (i.e. operator of the signing function) had knowledge of the secret and utilised this knowledge with the specific *message* data, yet it does not reveal the secret itself, nor can knowledge of the signature be used to create other signatures (e.g. for alternative message data).

---

In this model, secrets are identified not by their actual data (which we assume only the signer knows) but rather a derivative counterpart (known as the *public key*) which maps 1:1 with the secret (and so can be used to identify it), yet does not compromise it.

---

### Digital Signatures on Plaintext

<br> 

Digital signatures are not limited to encryption. Some information you even want to share publicly.

<widget-text center>

**Example:** Instructions to transfer 10 tokens to another account.
Digital signatures still guarantee that the message is authentic and has not been modified (e.g. to 100 tokens).
</widget-text>

---

### Nonrepudiation

<br>

Only those with knowledge of some secret information could have produced a valid signature.

<widget-text center>

The signer cannot claim that the signature was forged, unless they can defend a claim that the secret was compromised prior to signing.
Symmetric cryptography does not provide this guarantee: someone else knows the secret.
</widget-text>

---

### Polkadot in Practice

<br>

<widget-text>

In Substrate and Polkadot, we use ECDSA, ed25519, and sr25519.

<br>

Of course a valid signature is a valid signature, and there are lots of libraries. Some specific to Polkadot/Substrate:

- Subkey (CLI)
- Substrate Primitives (runtime)
- Polkadot JS Crypto (applications)
</widget-text>

---

## Certifications

Certifications are used to make attestations about public key relationships.

<br>

<widget-text>

Typically in the form of a _signature_ on:

- One or more cryptographically strong identifiers (e.g. public keys, hashes).
- Information about its ownership, its use and any other properties that the signer is capable of attesting/authorising/witnessing.
- *(Meta-)information* about this information itself, such as how long it is valid for and external considerations which would invalidate it.
</widget-text>

---

### Certifications in Substrate

<br>

<widget-text center>

Practically speaking, in Substrate we will use certifications to:

- Associate physical hardware with on-chain accounts (called session keys)
- Link disparate and potentially keyless on-chain accounts in certain contexts (proxies)

Note:
See: https://docs.substrate.io/main-docs/fundamentals/accounts-addresses-keys/#specialized-accounts

---

## Hash Functions

**Motivation:** We often want a succinct representation of some data with the expectation that we are referring to the same data. A "fingerprint".

<br>

*Again, just an intro. There are lectures later in this module dedicated to hashes and hash-based data structures.*

---

### Hash Function Applications

<br>

<widget-text>

Hashes can be useful for many applications. 
Examples:

- Representation of larger data object (history, commitment, file)
- Keys in a database
- Digital signatures
- Key derivation
- Pseudorandom functions
</widget-text>

---

### Hash Function Properties

<widget-text>

Hashes need to:

1. Accept unbounded size input
1. Map to a bounded output
1. Be fast to compute
1. Be computable strictly one-way (difficult to find a pre-image for a hash)
1. Resist pre-image attacks (attacker controls one input)
1. Resist<sup>[1]</sup> collisions (attacker controls both inputs)

Note:
[1] Based on the first two properties, _there must exist_ infinite collisions. A.k.a. Dirichlet's Drawer Principle, a.k.a. pigeonhole principle.

---

<widget-image src="/assets/img/1-Cryptography/Hash Function Properties.png"></widget-image>

---

### Input Sensitivity

<br>

Changes to a hash are not related to the magnitude of change in the input. Example:

<br>

<widget-image src="/assets/img/1-Cryptography/Input Sensitivity.png"></widget-image>

</widget-column>
</widget-columns>

---

### Cryptographic vs. Non-Cryptographic

<br>

Cryptographic hash functions provide stronger guarantees on the last three properties.

<br>

<widget-text center>

But non-cryptographic hash functions are much faster.

Substrate uses both (more on that later).

---

### Digital Signatures (again)

<br>

Signing large amounts of data is inefficient. But hashing large amounts of data _is_.

<br>

Based on pre-image resistance, a signature on the hash of some data implies a signature on the data itself. That is, we assume that attackers are unable to find or construct some data that would generate the same output hash.

Requires that the verifier also compute the hash.

---

<widget-image src="/assets/img/1-Cryptography/Digital Signatures.png"></widget-image>

Note:
Useful class exercise: discuss some reasons why the 6 listed hash properties are so important now:
- If an attacker can find a colliding pre-image, they can "authorize" something unintended.
- Or if they can find a collision on their own, attempt to trick you into signing one.

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#8D3AED" -->

## Exercise

Discuss some reasons why the 6 listed hash properties are so important.

---

### Hash Examples in Substrate

<br>

<widget-text>


<widget-text>

**Sr25519 Signatures**

Sr25519 hashes the message as part of its signing process.

<br> 

**Transactions**

In transactions in Substrate, key holders sign a _hash of the instructions_ when the instructions are longer than 256 bytes.

</widget-text>

---

### Hashers in Substrate

<br>

<widget-text>

Substrate primarily uses two hashing algorithms:

- Blake2b (cryptographic)
- TwoX64 (non-cryptographic)

<br>

<widget-text center>
TwoX64 is about 20x faster.

---

---

### Database Keys

<br>

<widget-text>

**TwoX64** is safe to use when users (read: attackers) cannot control the input, e.g. when a database key is a system-assigned index.

<br>

**Blake2b** should be used for everything else.

<br>

*Again, there is a whole lecture on hash-based data structures.*

---

### Other Uses of Hashes in Substrate

<br>

<widget-text>

Hashes are also used for:

<br>

- Generating multisig accounts
- Generating system-controlled accounts
- Generating proxy-controlled accounts
- Representing proposals
- Representing claims (e.g. the asset trap)

---

## Summary

<widget-text>

Cryptography is much more than encryption. It's a toolkit that allows us to:

- Communicate on public networks, in the open
- Access information
- Have expectations about a message's authenticity and integrity
- Prove knowledge of some secret information
- Represent large amounts of data succinctly
