# What is Cryptography?

---

## How do _you_ define Cryptography?

### What can you _do_ with cryptographic techniques?

Notes:
EXERCISE - spend 3 to 5 minuets on this.
Start by asking for class to answer, no wrong answers!

<!-- TODO: exercise indicator https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-blockchain-academy/issues/67 -->

---

## [Cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography) defined:

"The practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior."

Cryptography **_was_** mainly concerned with _linguistic and lexicographic patterns_...

<!-- design: caesar cypher graphic example-->

Notes:
Cyphers, like caesar you may have heard of, are used to conceal messages from those able to read the messages.

---

## Cryptography in the digital age

Cryptography now makes **_extensive use of mathematics_**, including aspects of information theory, computational complexity, statistics, combinatorics, abstract algebra, number theory, and finite mathematics generally beginning with the seminal paper, [New direction in cryptography](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TIT.1976.1055638).

Notes:
Cracking the old algorithms for private messages is trivial for computers.
More sophisticated tools are needed that make obfuscation robust to very powerful actors with large resources to uncover (decrypt) the messages you are trying to hide.

---

# We will _not_ cover mathematics

The hard work of cryptographers we will _put to use_.

Notes:
How these systems work we assume is "magic", but _we will cover how to evaluate what to trust to be safe_.
We have great cryptographers here at the academy, after-hour, by all means ask about this if you wish to learn more.

---

## Applied cryptography

- Private data (Encryption)
- **Verifiable data** (Digital signatures, commitments, ...)

<!-- design: "montage" of web2 crypto protocols, graphics including HTTPS, OAuth,  -->

Notes:
More than just human langue, any language abstractly can be characterized a "data"
The Internet is generally public, crypto enables: privacy and verifiability... and more!
We don't need to know any math to use web2 that has many cryptographic tools deeply embedded in them, like those here.
ASK CLASS: What cryptographic tools do you recognize here (graphics)? What are most important to you?

---

## Cryptography is **_The foundation_** of distributed systems

<!-- todo design: less trust, more truth graphic -->

Notes:
These are powerful tools that enable distributed systems to function.
Many things we need to operate in hostile environments in web3 are impossible without them!

---

## Cryptography in Web3

- Verifiability of data _integrity_.
- Authentication of data _origin_.
- Efficiency of data _compression_.

Notes:
Blockchains core value proposition rests on data integrity and origin.
Data compression that is also verifiable is key to scalability and enabling lower-powered devices to join a network.

---

## Applied Cryptographic Primitives

<!-- TODO

https://github.com/PratyushRT/blockchainsS21/blob/master/LectureSlides/

use lesson 1&2 in these to develop slides in this section.
FOCUS ON APPLICATION - deeper logic of how they work should be referenced only, and left as references & exercises for students _after_ academy / after-hours with experts attending.
-->

<!-- TODO: linked list of all top level slides defining primitives -->

- Symmetric & Asymmetric Encryption
- Digital Signatures
- Hashes
- Commitments
- Erasure Coding
- (Pseudo)Random Number Generation

---

## Encryption

The obfuscation of data from unintended parties' view.

There are two primary classes of ways to archive this:

1. [Symmetric Key Cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm)
2. [Asymmetric (Pubic) Key Cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography)

_Encryption is not typically core to blockchain protocols, but it is used in networking_

Notes:
This is something you've all used. "Encrypted" messages in
Telegram, etc. Secret transfer of a message between someone and someone else. Enigma, etc.
Solves the problem of getting a message from one party to another without it being interceptable by others.

---

## Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Key Cryptography

TODO: Define here, reference glossary

_We always need a function that’s easy to compute but hard to reverse._

<!-- TODO unpack slides from https://www.jigsawacademy.com/blogs/cyber-security/symmetric-and-asymmetric-key-cryptography -->

---

## Symmetric applications

- Hash functions: large input, small-ish output.
- Provide fingerprinting, commitments,
- Pseudo-random generators (PRNGs): small-ish input key, arbitrarily long output.

Notes:
Symmetric crypto mixes unrelated mathematical operations, ala bitwise and arithmetic.

---

## Asymmetric applications

### _A.K.A. Public-key Crypto_

- Key exchange mix two people secret
- Signatures proof-knowledge of some secret
- Zero-knowledge proofs of correct evaluation of some circuit (signatures being a simple special case)

Notes:
Asymmetric crypto works only with one mathematical object’s arithmetic, which gives homomorphic properties, but demands some inverse operation be much harder, ala division by multiplication.

---

# Speed is advantage on symmetric over asymmetric

<!-- todo: expand on this core idea, discuss trade offs of each. When to use them concretely explained -->

---

## Digital Signatures

<!-- todo: this is lesson 2 and 3, don't linger -->

- Asymmetric crypto applied to _verify origin_.
- Wallets
<!-- TODO: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography  images and explain -->

- Solves for Problems:
  - How do you prove that possessions are yours?
  - How do you make sure that one person can do something and others can't
  - How do we know that you are you?
- asymmetric/public key cryptography
  - mathematic requirements
    - example: elliptic curve

There are lots of types of signatures!

---

## Hashes

(such as Fingerprints/Digests)

- Solves For Problems:
  - How do we ensure we have the same shared history?
  - How do we know we referring to the same referent?
  - How can we ensure that we are assured that what we are looking at comes from the same
    truth?
- The source of truth comes from the same Merkle root, and this convinces everyone else;
- Metaphor: Fingerprint
- Metaphor: A bibliographic reference referring to a book in a library; how can we follow it backward to a shared, reliable reference AND verify that is a perfect representation of a small part of a huge corpus of data?
  - Example: In this book on this page on this library, but you need to know using only a small piece of information

Hashes can be used in lots of ways!

---

## Applied Hashing

A hash is used as a commitment a _single string_.
What if we want to commit to something that's structured, that we want to verify a small part of (a fundamental need in Blockchain cryptography)?

- Merkle Trees are a hash-based data structure that entails lots of hashing.
- Merkle Tree is a commitment to a list or set, that can be enormous.
- A Merkle Trie is a commitment to a database. Tree that does a specific thing, which is looking up values from keys.

A blockchain is also a hash-based data structure(!)

Could be for a single piece of data (a hash is a commitment for a single piece)

- For a Merkle tree, you're only interested in a particular piece of it
- Instances include: - Merkle Root: Summary of the data that you can compare against. Single hash you get from the library.
  It's a commitment to everything in the library.
  - Merkle Proof: Convinces you that it's the right referent, kind of a lookup path to verify that the data came from the database with the Merkle Root
  - The Merkle root is the thing we're agreeing on and that the authority is giving us, but the Merkle PROOF can come from anywhere.

* "A hash function, otherwise known as a one-way hash function, takes an arbitrary message of arbitrary length and creates an output (a hash) of a fixed length."
  The main characteristics of a cryptographic hash function are that given a message, it is easy to compute the hash; given the hash, it is difficult to compute the message; and that given a message, it is difficult to find a different message that would produce the same hash (this is known as a collision)

## Commitments

(using hashes & signatures)

<!-- todo: move to lesson 3? -->

---

## Erasure Coding

That's the last primitive we use, but we'll get into later.

## References

<!--
Compile an **annotated** list of URLs to source material referenced in making these lessons.
Ideally this is exhaustive, it can be cleaned up before delivery to students, but must include _why_ a reference is used.
For example:
- [ss58-registry](https://github.com/paritytech/ss58-registry) - A list of known SS58 account types as an enum, typically used by the Polkadot, Kusama or Substrate ecosystems.
- [wiki on parathreads](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-parathreads) - A description of the parathread model.
