## Pre-requisites

No background in math or cryptography is necessary.

Notes:
College level mathematical maturity in algebra and probability is helpful.

---

# What is Cryptography?

---

## How do _you_ define Cryptography?

### What can you _do_ with cryptographic techniques?

Notes:
EXERCISE - spend 3 to 5 minuets on this.
Start by asking for class to answer, no wrong answers!

<!-- TODO: exercise indicator https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-blockchain-academy/issues/67 -->

---

## [Cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography) defined:

"The practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior."

Cryptography **_was_** mainly concerned with _linguistic and lexicographic patterns_...

<!-- design: caesar cypher graphic example-->

Notes:
Cyphers, like caesar you may have heard of, are used to conceal messages from those able to read the messages.

---

## Cryptography in the digital age

Cryptography now makes **_extensive use of mathematics_**, including aspects of:

- information theory
- computational complexity
- statistics
- combinatorics
- abstract algebra
- number theory
- finite mathematics

The seminal paper: [New direction in cryptography](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TIT.1976.1055638).

Notes:
Cracking the pre-digital algorithms for private messages is trivial for computers.
More sophisticated tools are needed that make obfuscation robust to very powerful actors with large resources to uncover (decrypt) the messages you are trying to hide.

---

# We will _not_ cover mathematics

The hard work of cryptographers we will _put to use_.

Notes:
How these systems work we assume is "magic", but _we will cover how to evaluate what to trust to be safe_.
We have great cryptographers here at the academy, after-hour, by all means ask about this if you wish to learn more.

---

## Applied cryptography

- Private data (Encryption, ZK, ...)
- **Verifiable data** (Digital signatures, commitments, ...)
- Data compression (ZK STARKs, ...)

<!-- design: "montage" of web2 crypto protocols, graphics including HTTPS, OAuth,  -->

Notes:
The Internet is generally public, crypto enables privacy, verifiability, and more!
We don't need to know any math to use web2 that has many cryptographic tools deeply embedded in them, like those here.
ASK CLASS: What cryptographic tools do you recognize here (graphics)? What are most important to you?

---

## Cryptography is **_the foundation_** of distributed systems

<!-- todo design: less trust, more truth graphic -->

Notes:
These are powerful tools that enable distributed systems to function.
Many things we need to operate in hostile environments in web3 are impossible without them!

---

## Cryptography in Web3

- Verifiability of data _integrity_.
- Authentication of data _origin_.
- Efficiency of data _compression_.

Notes:
Blockchains core value proposition rests on data integrity and origin.
Data compression that is also verifiable is key to scalability and enabling lower-powered devices to join a network.

---

## Applied Cryptographic Primitives

<!-- TODO

https://github.com/PratyushRT/blockchainsS21/blob/master/LectureSlides/

use lesson 1&2 in these to develop slides in this section.
FOCUS ON APPLICATION - deeper logic of how they work should be referenced only, and left as references & exercises for students _after_ academy / after-hours with experts attending.

## Encryption

Provides obfuscation of data {from unintended parties' view}:

1. [Symmetric Key Cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm)
2. [Asymmetric (Pubic) Key Cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography)

Notes:
This is something you've all used. "Encrypted" messages in
Telegram, etc. Secret transfer of a message between someone and someone else. Enigma, etc.
Solves the problem of getting a message from one party to another without it being interceptable by others.
Encryption is not typically core to blockchain protocols, but it is used in networking between nodes and users' connections to these nodes.

---

## Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Key Cryptography

<!-- TODO: Define here, reference glossary -->

Both use _keys_: a {unique, large} integer value

Symmetric = Single key to encrypt _and_ decrypt
Asymmetric = Two keys, one to encrypt and another to decrypt

_We always need a function that’s easy to compute but hard to reverse._

<!-- TODO unpack slides more from https://www.jigsawacademy.com/blogs/cyber-security/symmetric-and-asymmetric-key-cryptography use in references-->

Notes:
The symmetry here is referring to the way encryption can be reversed (decrypted) to reveal the original data.

---

# Symmetric is _faster_ than asymmetric crypto

<!-- todo: SMEs expand on this core idea from lesson planning, discuss trade offs of each. When to use them concretely explained -->

---

## Symmetric Encryption

- **Stream ciphers**: Encrypt a message’s digits or letters one at a time.

- **Block ciphers**: Encrypt a group of bits as a single entity, inserting the plaintext to make it a block size multiple. 128-bit blocks
  64-bit blocks are widely used. The NIST-approved Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm and the GCM block cipher mode of operation all use 128-bit blocks.

---

## Symmetric applications

- Hash functions: large input, small-ish output.
  - Provides fingerprinting, commitments.
- Pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs): small-ish input key, arbitrarily long output.

Notes:
Symmetric crypto mixes unrelated mathematical operations, ala bitwise and arithmetic.

---

## Asymmetric Encryption

### _A.K.A. Public-key Crypto_

<!-- design: public key graphic, likely one or more from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography -->

Notes:
Asymmetric needs two keys: a PUBLIC key to encrypt and a PRIVATE (or secret) key to decrypt.

---

## Asymmetric applications

- Key exchange mix two people's secret
- Signatures proof-knowledge of some secret
- Zero-knowledge proofs of correct evaluation of some circuit (signatures being a simple special case)

Notes:
Asymmetric crypto works only with one mathematical object’s arithmetic, which gives homomorphic properties, but demands some inverse operation be much harder, ala division by multiplication.

---

## Asymmetric protocols

- Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (**RSA**)
- Elliptic Curve Cryptography (**ECC**)

<!-- todo: others of note? -->

---

## RSA vs ECC

<!-- Source: https://www.ssl2buy.com/wiki/rsa-vs-ecc-which-is-better-algorithm-for-security -->

Both are public-key cryptosystems.

_RSA is being replaced as the current standard by ECC_

Notes:
The biggest differentiator between ECC and RSA is key size.

---

## RSA – Rivest-Shamir-Adleman

Based on the difficulty of factoring large integers.

- Slow key generation, high compute resource needs.
- Vulnerable against quantum computers and brute force attack.
- Very large key size.
- _Very fast, very simple encryption._

---

## ECC – Elliptic Curve Cryptography

Relies on Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP)

- _Very hard to brute force._
- _Very small key size._
- _Fast key generation, moderate compute resource needs._
- _Very fast, very simple encryption._

Notes:
There is no known solution to the mathematical problem posed by the equation that produces the elliptical curve in a graph, and so the only solution is to try random numbers.
ECC is the primary cryptosystem we concern ourselves with in

---

## Digital Signatures

Scheme for verifying the authenticity of digital messages or documents.

- Solves for Problems:
  - How do you prove that possessions are yours?
  - How do you make sure that one person can do something and others can't?
  - How do we know that you are you?

<!-- TODO design: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography  images and explain -->

Notes:
A valid digital signature, where the prerequisites are satisfied, gives a recipient very high confidence that the message was created by a known sender (authenticity), and that the message was not altered in transit (integrity).
REMINDER: next lesson is devoted to this! We won't dig deeper just yet.

---

## Hashes

Metaphor: Digital Fingerprints

<!-- TODO design: hash fingerprint graphic -->

- Solves For Problems:
  - How do we ensure we have the same shared history? (_git_)
  - How do we know we referring identical data? (_SHA digest_)

Notes:
REMINDER: Lesson 5 is all about hashes, and 6 is about hash-based-data structures. We will detail more there

---

## Commitments

(TODO using hashes & signatures)

<!-- todo: move to lesson 3? -->

---

## Erasure Coding

That's the last primitive we use, but we'll get into later.

---

## How should I integrate crypto?

<!-- TODO: get SME to see what they think about this as a segment. Might be fluff, if not, needs improvement. goal is to establish criteria for selecting crypto primitives to use -->

1. Identify the right primitives for the use case
2. Select an _established standard implementation_ for each
3. Build it
4. Audit it

Notes:
Evaluation of what cryptographic primitives to use is critical.
Using a sound implication is perhaps even more critical, as composing systems with incorrect (or correct, but you don't use it correctly) implementations is ripe to be attacked!

<!-- TODO: reference https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2s3_UG9IPU as example? highlights bad use of correct impl, and showcases how to "break" cryptographic assumptions -->

---

# _Don't roll your own crypto!_

Notes:
It is so easy to get things wrong, it's best not to try to make an impl of any crypto primitives. Use libs that are well established and make sure you know exactly how to use them correctly.
