# Crack the Many Time Pad

If we choose to use it, we can generate our own ciphertexts and key.

## Introdocution

The symmetric stream cipher or "one-time pad" is known to be secure when the key is only used once. In practice key distribution is not always practical, and users sometimes make the critical mistake of reusing a pre-shared key. In this ctivity, students will experience first hand why reusing the key is detrimental to security.

## The Challenge

The following several ciphertexts were all intercepted. We believe they may have been encrypted with the same key. You task is to extract _all_ of the plaintexts as well as the original key.

TODO Generate the ciphertexts.

# Helpful Hints

* Dan Boneh's Original Hint: XOR the ciphertexts together, and consider what happens when a space is XORed with a character in [a-zA-Z].
