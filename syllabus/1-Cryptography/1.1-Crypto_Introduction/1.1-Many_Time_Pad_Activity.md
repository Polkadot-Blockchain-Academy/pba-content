# Crack the Many Time Pad

## Citation

This activity is cribbed from Dan Boneh's [Coursera Cryptography I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto/quiz/KZ9js/week-1-programming-assignment-optional/attempt) course.

The goal of this activity is to teach students how to generate their own ciphertexts and key.

## Introduction

The symmetric stream cipher or "one-time pad" is known to be secure when the key is only used once. In practice key distribution is not always practical, and users sometimes make the critical mistake of reusing a pre-shared key. 

In this activity, students will experience first hand why reusing the key is detrimental to security.

## The Challenge

The following several ciphertexts were all intercepted. We believe they may have been encrypted with the same key. Your task is to extract _all_ of the plaintexts as well as the original key.

You can generate your own ciphertexts with the included `generate_ciphertexts.py` file, but SPOILER ALERT, the plaintexts for this exercise are hardcoded in there, so no peaking.

# Helpful Hints

* Dan Boneh's Original Hint: XOR the ciphertexts together, and consider what happens when a space is XORed with a character in [a-zA-Z].
* Consider Crib dragging: https://samwho.dev/blog/toying-with-cryptography-crib-dragging/

Potential Solution: https://joshorndorff.github.io/DanBonehsCryptoExercises/crib-dragging/ is a tool used to perform crib dragging interactively
