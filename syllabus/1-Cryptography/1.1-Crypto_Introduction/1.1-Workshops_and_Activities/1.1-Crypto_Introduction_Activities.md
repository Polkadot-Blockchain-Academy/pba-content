# Design a cryptosystem

Format: groups of 5
Time: 45 minutes work, 30 mins presentations

Using what you know _conceptually_ about the tools that we learned so far, define a step-wise protocol composed of them to do one of the following:

- {TODO define a few options}
- ...

Write out the steps involved, and add commentary about your process, and document the "gotchas" - things that could go wrong using this specific protocol.
Be sure to write down _all_ your assumptions as you progress.
Please form some questions and ask TAs as yo progress.

Present 3 teams (first come first serve, can't do all 10 teams) describing the protocol and get feedback from the instructors & industry practitioners in the audience.
Don't fret if the feedback is harsh, part of the point is to illustrate how error prone cryptosystem design is!
