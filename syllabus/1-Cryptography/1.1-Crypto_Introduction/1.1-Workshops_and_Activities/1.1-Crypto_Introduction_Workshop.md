# Cryptographic vs. non-cryptographic Hashing

ExCvR Jupyter based notebook on using some example hashing libs of each type.
1. Contrast both libs used on same data
1. Demonstrate collision with non-crypto (brute force on very simple one)
1. 

# Decrypt a signed message

ExCvR Jupyter based notebook on using some example pub key libs.
1. start with key pair, message, and pub key
1. demonstrate how to decrypt msg w/ pub key
1. students asked to generate a key pair
1. students sign a "I was at the Polkadot Academy 2022" type message
1. students post signed msg and pub key to a shared doc/repo/hackmd
1. students validate each other's signed messages 

## (possible alternative) <https://keybase.io> walk though

_More of a "user land" demo than engineering focused_
Show application of many crypto primitives that compose their platform:
- user accounts & keys
- verified messages attesting to account ownership
- encrypted chat rooms
- signing & verifying messages
- "following" = signing and attesting to other's credentials + adding to merkle trie of all users + root on Stellar blockchain. 
_Dan Shields has material and can run this if so desired_
