# Hash Based Data Structures

---

## Comparison to pointer based data structures

<br>

<widget-text style="padding: 0 200px 0 200px ">

- A hash is a commitment to what is in the linked part.
  A pointer tells you where it is
- We can't have cycles of hashes

## Hash chains

## Merkle trees

<br>

A binary Merkle tree:

<!--

<widget-image style="width: 50vw" src="/assets/img/1-Cryptography/Merkle tree.png"></widget-image>
</center>
-->

<center>
<widget-image style="width: 50vw" src="/assets/img/1-Cryptography/Merkle tree all purple.png"></widget-image>
</center>

---

## Proofs

<br>

<widget-text style="padding: 0 200px 0 200px ">

- The root or head hash is a commitment to the entire data structure
- Generate a proof by expanding some but not all hashes

---

## Proofs: Merkle copaths

</center>

Notes:

Given the children of a node, we can compute a node
Given the purple nodes and the white leaf, we can compute the white nodes bottom to top.
If we compute the correct root, this proves that the leaf was in the tree

---

## Security

<br>

<widget-text style="padding: 0 200px 0 200px ">

- collision resistance
  - can give only-one preimage for each hash
  - so a binding commitment to the link

Notes:

explain what could happen when this fails.

---

<widget-text style="padding: 0 200px 0 200px ">

- Proof of a leaf has size $O(\log n)$
- and so do proofs of updates of a leaf

---

## Key-value databases and tries

---

## Key-value database

<br>

<widget-text style="padding: 0 200px 0 200px ">

The data structure stores a map `key -> value`

We should be able to:

1. Add new `<key,value>` pairs.
1. Change the value associated with an existing key.
1. For any key, if `<key,value>` is in the database, we can prove it.
1. If no value is associated to a key, we need to be able to prove that as well.

## Types of data structures we'll look at

<br>

<widget-text style="padding: 0 200px 0 200px ">

- _**Trees**_ are Rooted, Undirected Acyclic Graphs
- _**Merkle Trees**_ are _trees_ which use hashes as links.
- _**Tries**_ are a particular class of _trees_ where:
  - Given a particular piece of data, it will always be on a particular path.
- _**Radix Tries**_ are a particular class of a trie where:
  - The location of a value is determined the path constructed one digit at a time.
- _**Patricia Tries**_ are _radix tries_ which are optimized to ensure lonely node-paths are consolidated into a single node.

## Radix Trie

_Words:_ to, tea, ted, ten, inn, A.

<br>

<center>
<widget-image style="width: 50vw" src="/assets/img/1-Cryptography/Trie.png"></widget-image>
</center>

<br>

Each node splits on the next digit in base $r$

---

## Patricia Trie

_Words:_ to, tea, ted, ten, inn, A.

<br>

<center>
<widget-image style="width: 50vw" src="/assets/img/1-Cryptography/Patricia Trie.png"></widget-image>
</center>

<br>

If only one option for a sequence we merge them.

</center>

<!-- TODO maybe some code stuff with extension nodes etc. -->

---

## Hash trie

<br>

<widget-text style="padding: 0 200px 0 200px ">

- We may pre-hash the data before inserting it
- This improves the balance... except under attack!
- Could be a Merkle trie or regular.

---

## Computational and storage trade-offs

<br>

<widget-text style="padding: 0 200px 0 200px ">

- What radix $r$ is best?
- Proof size of a leaf is $r \log_r n$
  - $r=2$ gives the smallest proof for one leaf

...but:

- higher branching at high levels of the tree can give smaller batch proofs.
- For storage, it is best to read consecutive data so high $r$ is better.

---

## Merkle Mountain Ranges

<br>

<widget-text style="padding: 0 200px 0 200px ">

- Append only data structure
- Lookup elements by number

---

## Merkle Mountain Ranges

<center>
<widget-image style="width: 50vw" src="/assets/img/1-Cryptography/U-MMR 13.png"></widget-image>
</center>

Notes:

we have several Merkle trees of sizes that are powers of two.
The trees that are here correspond to the binary digits of 13 that are 1.

</center>

Notes:

- Not as balanced as a binary tree but close
- Can update the peak nodes alone on-chain

---

## Succinct proving with cryptography?

<br>

<widget-text style="padding: 0 200px 0 200px ">

- ZK friendly hashes
- Non-hashed based data structures
  - RSA accumulators
  - Polynomial commitment based
    - Verkle trees
