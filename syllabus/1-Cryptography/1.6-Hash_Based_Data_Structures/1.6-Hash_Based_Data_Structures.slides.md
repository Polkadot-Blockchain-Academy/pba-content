## Hash-based Data Structures

A hash is used as a commitment a _single string_.
What if we want to commit to something that's structured, that we want to verify a small part of (a fundamental need in Blockchain cryptography)?

- Merkle Trees are a hash-based data structure that entails lots of hashing.
- Merkle Tree is a commitment to a list or set, that can be enormous.
- A Merkle Trie is a commitment to a database. Tree that does a specific thing, which is looking up values from keys.

A blockchain is also a hash-based data structure(!)

Could be for a single piece of data (a hash is a commitment for a single piece)

- For a Merkle tree, you're only interested in a particular piece of it
- Instances include: - Merkle Root: Summary of the data that you can compare against. Single hash you get from the library.
  It's a commitment to everything in the library.
  - Merkle Proof: Convinces you that it's the right referent, kind of a lookup path to verify that the data came from the database with the Merkle Root
  - The Merkle root is the thing we're agreeing on and that the authority is giving us, but the Merkle PROOF can come from anywhere.

* "A hash function, otherwise known as a one-way hash function, takes an arbitrary message of arbitrary length and creates an output (a hash) of a fixed length."
  The main characteristics of a cryptographic hash function are that given a message, it is easy to compute the hash; given the hash, it is difficult to compute the message; and that given a message, it is difficult to find a different message that would produce the same hash (this is known as a collision)

- The source of truth comes from the same Merkle root, and this convinces everyone else;
- Metaphor: A bibliographic reference referring to a book in a library; how can we follow it backward to a shared, reliable reference AND verify that is a perfect representation of a small part of a huge corpus of data?
  - Example: In this book on this page on this library, but you need to know using only a small piece of information

# Exercise title

### _Describe it here_

## Exercise instructions

<!--
Detail what you want students to do in your exercise
Most exercises are less than 15 minuets in length.

Notes:
Make sure to include things here to say to students, perhaps a hint or two.
Realize that students will be able to view the speaker's notes, as they will have access to them on their devices.

## Conclusion

<!-- Summarize what we just learned, and put it in the bigger picture of what the Academy and Web3 are all about. -->

---

## Next steps

<!--
Compile a list of:
- topics not covered here but students should consider learning about independently
- examples of the concepts covered in this lesson applied to a project, to case-study
- useful resources related to the lesson

- Reference other slides/materials by relative directory in this repo, like the [copy-paste slide templates](../../content-templates/slides/copy-paste-reveal-template-slides.md)

## References

<!--
Compile an **annotated** list of URLs to source material referenced in making these lessons.
Ideally this is exhaustive, it can be cleaned up before delivery to students, but must include _why_ a reference is used.
For example:

- [ss58-registry](https://github.com/paritytech/ss58-registry) - A list of known SS58 account types as an enum, typically used by the Polkadot, Kusama or Substrate ecosystems.
- [wiki on parathreads](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-parathreads) - A description of the parathread model.
