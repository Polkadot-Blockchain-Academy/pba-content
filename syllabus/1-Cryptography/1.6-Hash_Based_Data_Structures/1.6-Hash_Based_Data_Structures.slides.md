## Hash linked structures

### Comparison to pointer based data structures

<br>

<widget-text style="padding: 0 200px 0 200px ">


 - A hash is a commitment to what is in the linked part
 	- a pointer tells you where it is
 - We can't have cycles of hashes

### Hash chains

### Merkle trees

<br>

A binary Merkle tree:

<!-- <widget-image src="/assets/img/1-Cryptography/Merkle tree.png"></widget-image> -->

<widget-image src="/assets/img/1-Cryptography/Merkle tree all purple.png"></widget-image>

---

### Proofs

<br>

<widget-text style="padding: 0 200px 0 200px ">

- The root or head hash is a commitment to the entire data structure

- Generate a proof by expanding some but not all hashes

---

### Proofs: Merkle copaths

<widget-image src="/assets/img/1-Cryptography/Merkle Copaths.png"></widget-image>

Notes:

Given the children of a node, we can compute a node

Given the purple nodes and the white leaf, we can compute the white nodes bottom to top.

If we compute the correct root, this proves that the leaf was in the tree

### Security

<br>

<widget-text style="padding: 0 200px 0 200px ">

- collision resistance
	- can give only-one preimage for each hash
	- so a binding commitment to the link
	
Notes: explain what could happen when this fails.

---

<widget-text style="padding: 0 200px 0 200px ">

- Proof of a leaf has size $O(\log n)$
- and so do proofs of updates of a leaf

## Key-value databases and tries

---

### Key-value database

<br>

<widget-text style="padding: 0 200px 0 200px ">

The data structure stores a map 
`key -> value`

We should be able to 

1. add new `<key,value>` pairs

2. change the value associated with an existing key.

3. For any key, if `<key,value>` is in the database, we can prove it.

4. If no value is associated to a key, we need to be able to prove that as well

---
### Tries

---

### Hash trie (maybe pointer based)

<br>

<widget-text style="padding: 0 200px 0 200px ">

 - A trie where we use prefixes of the hash of the key
 - Improves balance
     - except under attack!

---

### Basic radix trie

<br>

<widget-text style="padding: 0 200px 0 200px ">

- Each node splits on the next digit in base $r$

---
### Patricia Trie

<br>

<widget-text style="padding: 0 200px 0 200px ">

- As radix, but if there is only one option for a sequence of digits, we can merge them.

<!-- maybe some code stuff with extension nodes etc. -->

### Computational and storage trade-offs

<br>

<widget-text style="padding: 0 200px 0 200px ">

- What radix $r$ is best?

- proof size of a leaf is $r \log_r n$
	- $r=2$ gives the smallest proof for one leaf

- but
	- higher branching at high levels of the tree can give smaller batch proofs.
	- For storage, it is best to read consecutive data so high $r$ is better.

### Merkle Mountain Ranges

<br>

<widget-text style="padding: 0 200px 0 200px ">

- Append only data structure

- Lookup elements by number

---

<widget-image src="/assets/img/1-Cryptography/U-MMR 13.png"></widget-image>


Notes: 

we have several Merkle trees of sizes that are powers of two. 

The trees that are here correspond to the binary digits of 13 that are 1.

<widget-text style="padding: 0 200px 0 200px ">


- Not as balanced as a binary tree but close

- can update the peak nodes alone on-chain

### Succinct proving with cryptography?

<br>

<widget-text style="padding: 0 200px 0 200px ">


- ZK friendly hashes
- Non-hased based data structures
	- RSA accumulators
	- Polynomial commitment based
		- Verkle trees
