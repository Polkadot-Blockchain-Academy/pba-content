HASH: SUPER FAST

1. Hash the message "Welcome to PBA 02 Buenos Aires"
   Commit the hash

2. Hash the message "Welcome to PBA 02 Buenos Aires, [INSERT YOUR ELEMENT HANDLE]"
   Commit the hash

SYMETRIC: SUPER SLOW 3. Generate a private key, send it to one of your colleagues
XOR Encrypt "Welcome to PBA 02 Buenos Aires, [INSERT YOUR ELEMENT HANDLE]"
Both send me their encrypted messages
We will publish a list with the message pairs, you should pick any pair that is not yours and try to engineer whose pair it is
Yes you can just ask your colleagues but those who submit a guess will either have to present their technique to the group or submit it written for evaluation. Submissions of answers without engineering process will not be accepted

ASYMETRIC: MEDIUM 4. Generate a private and public key pair
Commit your public key
We will gather the list of public key and randomly assign you a public key for you to send a message to
Write a message, encrypt it with the public key assigned to you
Commit your encrypted message
Send us the hash of your plain text message
Brute force the list to find the message addressed to your pubkey
Commit the hash of the received message
We will publish the list of hashes and the only answers accepted will be commited hashes that are on the list

SIGNATURES: I THINK THIS CAN BE DONE IN A MORE SOCIAL ACTIVITY TIME AND THEN VERIFIED NEXT DAY 5. With your previous key pair
Key signing party with your colleagues
Commit all signatures you got
Your final points will be calculated based on the amout of TRUE signatures you have

KEY DERIVATION: SUPER FAST 6. Hard derive a grandchild to your key TODO

7. Soft derive 5 addresses from your key
   Commit all addresses

MNEMONICS: FAST 8. Generate a 24 words mnemonic
Try to run it in this list of key derivation algorithms TODO
Commit the hash of your answers to if it breaks (1) or not (0) IN ORDER

CERTIFICATES 9. TODO

MULTISIG: MEDIUM 10. Gather 5 colleagues:
Decide for a common message
Sign the message with threshold multisig
Commit signature + verifying key
Sign the message with non-threshold multisig
Commit signatures + verifying key
N-1 Sign the message with ring signature
Commit signature + verifying key
We will randomly assing you 3 groups (one for each signature type) for your group to verify
Commit verification of each group

VRF 11. Cards Against Blockchain ?

ERASURE CODING: VERY SLOW 12. We will publish a list of information chunks, all with redundance X so that there are 15% corrupted and they can still get the message back with not too many chunks
Ask for them to rebuild the text
Commit text
Either everyone get points or no-one does

ZK PROOFS 13. Something with Schnorr signatures TODO
Maybe give them a big chunk of data that they should compress like a rollup type of scheme as a group
Or do a random oblivious transfer type of thing with each

MERKLE TREES 14. TODO
