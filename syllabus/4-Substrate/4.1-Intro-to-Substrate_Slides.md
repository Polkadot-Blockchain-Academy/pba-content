## What is Substrate?

Substrate is a **Rust framework** for **building blockchains** in a modular and extensible way.

---v

### Why Substrate?

<img src="../../../assets/img/4-Substrate/dev-4.1-maximalism.png"></img>

---v

### Why Substrate?

* ‚õìÔ∏è Future is multi-chain.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* üò≠ Building a blockchain is hard.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* üß† The need for a framework to build various blockchains is crucial for this future.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


> In general you shouldn't try to build a blockchain yourself from scratch. You will probably get it
> wrong.

### Core Philosophies of Substrate üí≠

The **non-substrate** way of thinking:

* Writing blockchains is hard.
* Upgrading blockchains is hard.
* We are going to spend maximal resources at making sure we get it right the first time.

---v

### Core Philosophies of Substrate üí≠

The **substrate** way of thinking:

* It all starts with a deep acknowledgment that **humans are fallible**.
* *It is only a matter of time until the "right choice" of today turns into a mistake in the future.*


---v

### Core Philosophies of Substrate üí≠

Outcomes of this:

* Rust as a language
* Upgradeability through a WASM meta-protocol.
* Generic. APIs >> Opinions.


---v

### Core Philosophies of Substrate: Rust as a language

* Memory safety is a fundamental issue in most major system-level programming languages.

<br>

* üò≠ `segfault`
* üòá You **cannot** make certain mistakes in Rust.
* üèéÔ∏è Most Rust abstractions are zero-cost. Rust has no "runtime". It as fast as a binary can be.


---v

### Core Philosophies of Substrate: Upgradeability

* üí™üèª Substrate is HIGHLY upgradable.
* üï∏Ô∏è Encoding the **application logic** of the chain as WASM, and storing it onchain, such that it can be upgraded on the fly.

---v

### Core Philosophies of Substrate: Generic

* Multiple consensus engines (BABE/Grandpa/AURA)
* Multiple network protocols (QUIC, TCP..)
* Multiple database implementations (ParityDB, RocksDB)
* Multiple ledger-state formats (UTXO, Account-based)

---v

### Core Philosophies of Substrate: Generic

* **AlephZero**: Custom consensus, DAG-based, 1s block time.
* **Moonbeam**: Ethereum compatible, build with substrate
* **HydraDX**: Custom transaction pool logic to match DEX orders.

### Substrate Architecture

---

## The Runtime

* The runtime contains all of the **business logic** of your chain.

...

* In a more *fancy* term, the runtime is the **state transition function**.

...

* In a more *technical* term, the definition of **how your blockchain executes blocks**.

...

> (WASM) Runtime ~ STF ~ Application Logic ~ Business Logic


---v

### State Transition

* **State:** The entire set of data that we want to come to consensus about.
* **Transition:** The runtime, the piece of logic that dictates how the state changes.

---v

### Consequences of *WASM* Runtime

* ü§ñ deterministic execution
* üß± sandboxing (more relevant in Polkadot)
* üåà Easier client/application diversification.
* üòé forkless upgrade!*

> *Arguably the biggest design choice of the whole substrate ecosystem.

---v

### ü§ñ Deterministic Execution

* The need for determinism in a blockchain runtime is *absolute*.

---v

### üß± Sandboxing

* Substrate uses the same WASM machinery for executing:

1. smart contracts
2. Parachain Runtime (i.e. PVF)

---v

### üåà Client Diversification

* A Substrate client written in a different language needs to ONLY implement the host/client side.
* Then, ALL SUBSTRATE BASED CHAINS will get a new client.
* WIP, Soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è

TODO: Brain explosion gif.

* Same story for an application that you write.

---v

### üòé Forkless Upgrade:

### What is WASM Anyways?

### What is WASM Anyways?

##### WASM ‚ù§Ô∏è WEB

<pba-cols>

<pba-col center>

* Streaming and rapid compilation.
* Designed with the concept of host in mind. Sandboxed, permissioned sys-calls.
* Secure for foreign code execution.

> People actually tried sticking things like JVM into the browser (*Java Applets*), but it didn't work.

### SMOLDOT

A true marvel of universe.

* (light) Substrate node compiled to WASM, by the browser.
* Itself executing another WASM blob, the aforementioned runtime.

---v

### How to Write a WASM Runtime?

* Any language that can compile to WASM and exposes a fixed set of functions, to be used by the
client.
* ... But, of course, Substrate comes with a framework to make thisdeveloper-friendly, **FRAME‚Ñ¢Ô∏è**.

---

## The Client

Everything else you need in a blockchain, except the consensus-critical, deterministic runtime we
just spoke of.

---v

### The Client

- Compiled to native.
- Less need for determinism.
- Has access to anything a normal native binary does (memory, disk, syscalls etc.)


---v

### The Client

<img style="width: 1200px;" src="../../../assets/img/4-Substrate/dev-4-3-full.svg">

---v

### The Client: Consensus ü§î

* Yes, consensus is not a core part of a blockchain runtime. It is not application logic. It is not something you want to customize.

* The consensus protocol is to your runtime what HTTP is to Facebook.


NOTE:

comments from Joshy:

I think this is important.

The runtime is the application you want to run. Consensus is outside of this application helping us
agree what the official state of this runtime is. Last wave I used this analogy.

Imagine a writers room for some TV show. Writers are sitting around coming up with potential plot
points for future episodes. Any of their ideas could work. But eventually they need to agree what
the next episode to air actually will be.


---v


### The Client: Database ü§î

* The client is in charge of storing the data, but has **no meaningful way to interpret it**.
* The database, from the client's PoV, is a *untyped*, *opaque*, key-value storage.
* The runtime knows which key means what.

> A few exceptions exist, like `:code` being the key for the WASM blob.

---v

### The Client: Database ü§î


<img style="width: 1000px" src="../../../assets/img/4-Substrate/dev-4-1-state-opaqueu.svg">

* Because the runtime can change independently!

### Example: SCALE vs JSON

* SCALE is an efficient, non-descriptive, binary encoding format, used EXTENSIVELY in the Substrate ecosystem.

```rust
use parity_scale_codec::{Encode};

#[derive(Encode)]
struct Example {
	number: u8,
	is_cool: bool,
	optional: Option<u32>,
}

fn main() {
	let my_struct = Example {
		number: 42,
		is_cool: true,
		optional: Some(69),
	};
	println!("{:?}", my_struct.encode());
	// [42, 1, 1, 69, 0, 0, 0]
	println!("{:?}", my_struct.encode().len());
	// 7
}
```

---v

### Example: SCALE vs JSON

```rust
use serde::{Serialize};

#[derive(Serialize)]
struct Example {
	number: u8,
	is_cool: bool,
	optional: Option<u32>,
}

fn main() {
	let my_struct = Example {
		number: 42,
		is_cool: true,
		optional: Some(69),
	};
	println!("{:?}", serde_json::to_string(&my_struct).unwrap());
	// "{\"number\":42,\"is_cool\":true,\"optional\":69}"
	println!("{:?}", serde_json::to_string(&my_struct).unwrap().len());
	// 42
}
```
