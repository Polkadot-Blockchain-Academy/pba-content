# Consensus

## Block authoring and Finality

Notes:

In this lecture, we will learn about the consensus protocols implemented in Substrate for block authoring (PoW, Aura and BABE) and finality (GRANDPA)

---

## What is consensus?

The blockchain has a state which is updated by executing the state transition function

We run the STF by creating new blocks (block execution)

- How do we decide who gets to author the next block?

- How do we reconcile diverging views of the current state?

- How can we be sure that a certain state is canonical and will never be reverted?

---

## What do we come to consensus on?

Consensus is a method for coming to agreement over a shared state

We want to come to agreement on what is the current canonical block

<img style="width: 700px" src="../../../assets/img/4-Substrate/4.6-forks.png"/>

<!-- TODO DESIGN: this image is a draft -->

Notes:

The consensus protocols don't care about what the blocks are actually doing, it doesn't care about the STF other than knowing whether it succeeded or not.

The protocol is just "blindly" coming to consensus on what block hashes are canonical.

---

<!-- TODO DESIGN: this image is a bit shitty but it conveys the right information, that consensus sits below the runtime and its mostly native code -->

---

## Fork choice

Given two (or more) different diverging states,<br>how do we choose which is the canonical fork?

Notes:

We might need to follow multiple forks temporarily, but the fork choice rule also affects immediately the decision on which block to build on top of.

---

## Finality

Given a certain state / block how certain can we be that it is canonical... and that it will stay canonical.

If we're certain that a block is canonical we consider it to be **finalized**.

<widget-text center>

This property can be either:

- Probabilistic
- Definite / Provable

Notes:

The practical notion we're trying to solve here is whether a given block is canonical or not, if it's not canonical it is possible that it might be reverted in the future.

Probabilistic finality is akin to eventual consistency, different nodes in the network might have different views of the canonical state at different times, but given enough time (unbound) they should all come to the same conclusion.

---

## CAP Theorem

![CAP Theorem](../../../assets/img/4-Substrate/4.6-cap-theorem.png)

---

## Proof of work

> Proof of work (PoW) is a form of cryptographic proof in which one party proves to others that a certain amount of a specific computational effort has been expended.

- Hard to generate the proof
- But cheap to verify
- Not a consensus mechanism by itself

---

## Nakamoto consensus

Anyone can extend the blockchain: to do so requires a proof that a certain amount of work has been completed.

Given a fork always follows the longest chain

---

## Nakamoto consensus

The PoW is a Sybil deterrence mechanism.

It is a stochastic process weighted by the relative computational power of participants.

The fork choice rule allows the participants to eventually reach consensus.

Finality is only _probabilistic_.

Notes:

Nakamoto consensus is eventually consistent so we don't have any definite notion of finality, only probabilistic.

As a certain block gets deeper in the history, the probability that it can be reverted gets lower and lower as doing so would require an enormous accumulated amount of computation. Still, it's non-zero.

---

## PoW in Substrate

Substrate ships with a "nakamoto consensus" implementation

It doesn't implement any specific PoW algorithm: users of the framework can plug their own

[Kulupu](https://github.com/kulupu/kulupu) is a project built on Substrate that uses PoW-based consensus

Notes:

https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/client/consensus/pow

---

## Moving away from PoW

PoW-based is very energy intensive

The work / computation being performed is in itself useless

We are achieving Sybil resistance by wasting a real-world resource (i.e. energy)

---

## Slot-based block authoring

Unlike PoW we must have a closed set of authorities with known identities

We discretize time into slots and at each slot we have a protocol to decide which of the authorities is entitled to author a block

---

## Aura (authority-round)

At each slot the authorities are chosen in a round-robin fashion:

```rust
authority(slot) = authorities[slot % authorities.len()];
```

1. The chosen authority is allowed to issue no more than one block during that slot
1. The longest chain is followed

---

## Aura (authority-round)

**Pros**

No wasted energy, simple to implement and to reason about

**Cons**

Attackable since the full schedule of block production is known in advance

You can preemptively attack the next block author to censor it

Notes:

We can setup a DoS attack on all the authorities as they move from slot to slot preventing them from successfully broadcasting their blocks to the network.

---

## Slots, but more like PoW?

We want to have a slot-based block authoring protocol that has similar properties to PoW.
Namely that we don't know who the next block author will be.

We want the slot assignment to be a stochastic process... but without the wasted energy.

---

## ...see an RNG?

```rust
threshold = 1 / number_of_authorities

should_author = rng(seed) < threshold
```

This is similar to what is happening with PoW.
The threshold is weighted by computation power (unlike in this example)

- How can we make sure that the random number generated by an authority was legitimate?
- How can we use randomness in the face of a deterministic execution environment?

---

## Verifiable Randomness Function

> A verifiable random function (VRF) is a public-key pseudorandom function that provides proofs that its outputs were calculated correctly.
> The owner of the secret key can compute the function value as well as an associated proof for any input value.
> Everyone else, using the proof and the associated public key can check that this value was indeed calculated correctly.

Can we use this primitive to assign slots to authorities?

---

## BABE

<widget-text style="font-size: 60px" center>

**B**lind **A**ssignment for **B**lockchain **E**xtension

---

## BABE

BABE is a block production mechanism<br>inspired by the [Ouroboros Praos protocol](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros_(protocol)>)

A slot-based block authoring algorithm using a VRF for assignment.
Nobody knows who the slot author is until they prove it.

A deterministic fallback mechanism ensuring there will always be a valid slot author.

Notes:

Read the original Ouroboros Praos paper [here](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/573.pdf)

---

## BABE

<widget-columns>
<widget-column>

As with Aura we start with a closed set of known authorities.

Time is discretized into slots, and sets of slots are grouped into epochs.

</widget-column>
<widget-column>

</widget-column>
</widget-columns>

---

## BABE

<widget-columns>
<widget-column>

Each slot can have a primary and secondary author (or "slot leader")

- Primary slots are assigned randomly (using a VRF)
- Secondary slots are assigned deterministically (with a similar mechanism as in Aura)

</widget-column>
<widget-column>

<img style="width: 600px" src="../../../assets/img/4-Substrate/4.6-slot-assignment.png"/>

</widget-column>
</widget-columns>

---

## BABE

<widget-columns>
<widget-column>

The current slot is a function of "real-world" time

```rust
current_slot = current_unix_time / slot_duration
```

</widget-column>
<widget-column>

<img style="width: 600px" src="../../../assets/img/4-Substrate/4.6-slot-assignment.png"/>

</widget-column>
</widget-columns>

Notes:

In Polkadot, one epoch is 4 hours and on Kusama one epoch is only 1 hour.

---

## Primary slots

At each slot authorities evaluate the VRF

VRFs generate a pseudo-random output along with a proof that it was properly generated

```rust
slot_author(slot, private_key) = vrf(seed, slot, private_key).output < threshold

threshold = 2 ^ vrf_output_length * (1 - (1 - c)) ^ (1 / number_if_authorities)

c is a constant 0 <= c < 1
```

Notes:

`c` must be chosen in accordance to the expected maximum network latency and slot duration.

It is part of the security model of BABE and outside the scope of this presentation.

See: https://research.web3.foundation/en/latest/polkadot/block-production/Babe.html

---

## Primary slots

<img style="width: 900px" src="../../../assets/img/4-Substrate/4.6-vrf-in-babe.png"/>

---

## Seeding the VRF

As with any RNG the VRF needs to take as input some random material (the seed)

We need to generate random material in a deterministic manner such that all participants agree on the seed

We will collect entropy from every VRF output

---

## Seeding the VRF

As an epoch progresses every VRF output used by a primary slot is stored

At the end of the epoch the stored data is concatenated

We hash this data and use it as the seed for a future epoch

---

## Using the VRF seed

The randomness computed at epoch $N$:

<widget-text center>

- is announced at the beginning of epoch<br>$N + 1$ (along with the authorities)
- and used on epoch $N + 2$

</widget-text>

<img style="width: 500px" src="../../../assets/img/4-Substrate/4.6-vrf-seeding.png"/>

This guarantees that by the time an authority has registered their intention to validate they don't know what the randomness for the epoch in which they'll be active is

---

## Primary slots

As with PoW the process of slot attribution is stochastic

Any slot can be assigned to 0, 1 or more validators

Having unassigned slots leads to variability in block times, as no authority will be able to produce a block on that slot

---

## Secondary slots

In order to avoid empty slots we assign all slots to a secondary validator

```rust
secondary_slot_author = hash(epoch_randomness ++ slot_number) % authorities_len
```

This mechanism guarantees a consistent block time

---

## Block predigest

```rust
pub enum BabePreDigest {
	/// A primary VRF-based slot assignment.
	Primary(PreDigest),
	/// A secondary deterministic slot assignment.
	Secondary(PreDigest),
}

pub struct PreDigest {
	/// Authority index
	pub authority_index: AuthorityIndex,
	/// Slot
	pub slot: Slot,
	/// VRF output
	pub vrf_output: VRFOutput,
	/// VRF proof
	pub vrf_proof: VRFProof,
}
```

A piece of data created by the consensus protocol and added to the block **before** it gets executed.
This is mainly used to pass consensus-related information into the runtime.

---

## Block seal

A digest that gets added to the block **after** execution

It should serve as an extra proof that the given validator in fact created that block

It's usually just a signature of the hash of the block header

<img style="width: 300px" src="../../../assets/img/4-Substrate/4.6-seal.png"/>

---

## Fork choice rule for BABE

Instead of just following the longest chain
We want to follow the chain that has the most primary slots

- Since these are the most secure slots
- Secondary slots can easily be censored (as in Aura)

---

### Fork choice rule for BABE

<img style="width: 600px" src="../../../assets/img/4-Substrate/4.6-babe-fork-choice.png"/>

---

## Provable finality

All consensus protocols presented so far only provide probabilistic finality

A BFT consensus protocol will achieve provably / instant finality as it is strongly consistent

- Given $N$ validators it requires $\frac{2}{3}N + 1$ validators to come to agreement
- $O(n^2)$ communication complexity

Notes:

The key thing to stress here is that BFT agreement is much slower as it requires a lot more communication.

Also it sacrifices liveness since $\frac{1}{3}$ of validators going offline halts the protocol.

---

## Hybrid consensus

Instead of making the block authoring protocol BFT tolerant, we create a gadget to perform BFT agreement on top of an already existing blockchain. i.e.:

- Participants of the protocol will vote on what they believe is the best chain
- What should be finalized

This way we use different protocols for block authoring and finality:

- Block authoring - eventually consistent, favors liveness, fast,
- Finality - strongly consistent, slow

---

## GRANDPA

<widget-text style="font-size: 40px" center>

**G**HOST-based **R**ecursive **AN**cestor **D**eriving **P**refix **A**greement

Notes: GHOST: Greedy Heaviest-Observed Sub-Tree

---

## GRANDPA

The protocol progresses in rounds

Every round the validators are required to do two rounds of voting: "prevote" and "precommit"

At the end of every round participants are guaranteed to reach consensus on what block is finalized.
Potentially the same block that had been previously finalized.

---

## GRANDPA

<img style="width: 850px" src="../../../assets/img/4-Substrate/4.6-validators-vote-on-chain.png"/>

---

## A GRANDPA round

(A node that is designated as the "primary" broadcasts the highest block that it thinks could be final from the previous round)

After waiting for a network delay, each validator broadcasts a "pre-vote" for the highest block that it thinks should be finalized

- If the super-majority of validators are honest, this block should extend the chain that the primary broadcast
- This new chain could be several blocks longer than the last finalized chain

---

## A GRANDPA round

<img style="width: 600px" src="../../../assets/img/4-Substrate/4.6-grandpa-round-1.png"/>

---

## A GRANDPA round

<img style="width: 600px" src="../../../assets/img/4-Substrate/4.6-grandpa-round-2.png"/>

---

## A GRANDPA round

Each validator computes the highest block that can be finalized based on the set of "pre-votes"

- i.e. we find the common ancestor of all votes that has support from more than $\frac{2}{3}N + 1$ validators
- We refer to this block as the "pre-vote ghost"

---

## A GRANDPA round

<img style="width: 600px" src="../../../assets/img/4-Substrate/4.6-grandpa-round-3.png"/>

---

## A GRANDPA round

We define the round "estimate" as the highest ancestor of the "prevote ghost" for which it is still possible to "precommit"

- i.e. when no "precommit" votes have been sent out yet, then `estimate == prevote ghost`

---

## A GRANDPA round

<img style="width: 600px" src="../../../assets/img/4-Substrate/4.6-grandpa-round-4.png"/>

---

## A GRANDPA round

If the "estimate" extends the last finalized chain, then each validator will cast a "precommit" for that chain.
Each validator waits to receive enough "precommits" to be able to finalize

- We again find the common ancestor of the "estimate" which has threshold "precommits"
- We declare that block as finalized

---

## A GRANDPA round

<img style="width: 600px" src="../../../assets/img/4-Substrate/4.6-grandpa-round-5.png"/>

---

## A GRANDPA round

<img style="width: 600px" src="../../../assets/img/4-Substrate/4.6-grandpa-round-6.png"/>

---

## A GRANDPA round

The round is deemed "completable":
 - if the "estimate" is lower than the "prevote-ghost"
 - or if it's impossible to have a supermajority on any block higher than the current "estimate"

Validators start a new round after it becomes "completable", but it is still kept running in the background

The round is deemed "concluded" when the round's "estimate" has been finalized (which might happen in a future round)

---

## A GRANDPA round

## GRANDPA vote messages

<widget-columns>
<widget-column>

```rust
/// A prevote for a block and its ancestors.
pub struct Prevote<Hash, Number> {
	/// The target block's hash.
	pub target_hash: Hash,
	/// The target block's number.
	pub target_number: Number,
}

/// A precommit for a block and its ancestors.
pub struct Precommit<Hash, Number> {
	/// The target block's hash.
	pub target_hash: Hash,
	/// The target block's number
	pub target_number: N,
}
```

</widget-column>
<widget-column>

```rust
/// A signed message.
pub struct SignedMessage<Hash, Number, Signature, Id> {
	/// The internal message which has been signed.
	pub message: Message<Hash, Number>,
	/// The signature on the message.
	pub signature: Signature,
	/// The Id of the signer
	pub id: Id,
}

/// A protocol message or vote.
pub enum Message<Hash, Number> {
	/// A prevote message.
	Prevote(Prevote<Hash, Number>),
	/// A precommit message.
	Precommit(Precommit<Hash, Number>),
	/// A primary proposal message.
	PrimaryPropose(PrimaryPropose<Hash, Number>),
}
```

</widget-column>
</widget-columns>

Notes:

GRANDPA supports weighted voting. For example, you could implement GRANDPA on your chain where validators with more stake get more votes.

---

## Extending BABE's<br>fork choice rule

<img style="width: 800px" src="../../../assets/img/4-Substrate/4.6-babe-grandpa-fork-choice.png"/>

Notes:

The black blocks are finalized, and the yellow blocks are not.
Blocks marked with a "1" are primary blocks; those marked with a "2" are secondary blocks.
Even though the topmost chain is the longest chain on the latest finalized block, it does not qualify because it has fewer primaries at the time of evaluation than the one below it.

---

## Updating the Validator Sets

So far we have assumed that the validator set is static

How do we go about updating the validator set?

Where does the information about new validators come from?

---

## Updating the Validator Sets

The information about new validators comes from the runtime

It is decided by some external process (usually staking)

The runtime exposes this information to external observers through header digests.
All consensus protocols provide a pallet to manage runtime state (e.g. validator sets)

The client-side consensus code is responsible for scraping those digests as new blocks are imported and react accordingly

Notes:

One of the main reasons this process is done through header digests is to make sure it is light client friendly, since light clients do not execute the runtime.

---

## Validator Set Changes - BABE

```rust
/// Information about the next epoch. This is broadcast in the first block
/// of the epoch.
pub struct NextEpochDescriptor {
	/// The authorities.
	pub authorities: Vec<AuthorityId>,

	/// The value of randomness to use for the slot-assignment.
	pub randomness: Randomness,
}
```

```rust
let next_epoch = NextEpochDescriptor {
	authorities: ...,
	randomness: ...,
};

// Create the digest that will go in the header. A consensus engine id
// is used to be able to identify the source of a given consensus digest.
let log = DigestItem::Consensus(BABE_ENGINE_ID, next_epoch.encode());
<frame_system::Pallet<T>>::deposit_log(log)
```

---

## Validator Set Changes - BABE

Validator set changes are applied on block import. They are announced one epoch in advance
when epoch N starts we announce what the authorities for epoch $N+1$ will be.

We need to keep track of the current authorities per fork.
In principle different forks could rotate to different validator sets.
We can discard this information as forks get finalized.

---

## Validator Set Changes - GRANDPA

```rust
/// A scheduled change of authority set.
pub struct ScheduledChange<Number> {
	/// The new authorities after the change, along with their respective weights.
	pub next_authorities: AuthorityList,
	/// The number of blocks to delay.
	pub delay: Number,
}
```

```rust
let log = ConsensusLog::ScheduledChange(ScheduledChange {
	delay: 0,
	next_authorities: ...,
});

let log = DigestItem::Consensus(GRANDPA_ENGINE_ID, log.encode());
<frame_system::Pallet<T>>::deposit_log(log);
```

---

## Validator Set Changes - GRANDPA

Validator set changes are applied on finality.
This is how we guarantee that the handoffs are secure.

At least $\frac{2}{3}N + 1$ validators signed off on it

They are announced for the immediate next session.

We also need to keep track of forks, even though they are only enacted on finality: they are announced through a forkfull protocol.

---

## Validator Set Changes - GRANDPA

Validator set changes applied on finality have some non-obvious implications.
If more than $\frac{1}{3}$ of authorities go offline, BABE will still keep making progress,
while GRANDPA will stall.

Which means that validator set changes will still keep being signaled...
But they won't be applied because no blocks are being finalized.

GRANDPA voters will need to finalize all the signaled validator set changes in-order.
Honest GRANDPA voters always limit their votes to the first pending validator set change

---

## Validator Set Changes - GRANDPA

<img style="width: 650px" src="../../../assets/img/4-Substrate/4.6-grandpa-scheduled-changes-2.png"/>

---

## Equivocations

We assume that at most $\frac{1}{3}$ of validators are byzantine.
If that threshold is passed GRANDPA breaks (i.e. we can finalize conflicting blocks).

But we still want to detect such faults / equivocations before we reach that threshold,
and punish those validators:

- At the very least we may want to remove them from the validator set
- Assuming that we are in a Proof-of-Stake system we might want to slash their deposits as well

---

## What is an equivocation in BABE or GRANDPA

1. Being offline / unresponsive

   - Hard to detect and prove effectively

1. Double voting
   - Signing two conflicting statements
   - Potentially distributing them to distinct sets of peers
   - **BABE** - a validator produces two distinct blocks at the same slot
   - **GRANDPA** - a validator sends two distinct prevote / precommit messages on the same round

---

## Double vote equivocations

<widget-columns>
<widget-column>

Proving this equivocation is easy: we just need to observe the two (or more) conflicting statements.
The statements themselves are the proof since they require cryptographic signatures.

This could not have been forged by some attacker.

</widget-column>
<widget-column>

```rust
/// Represents a BABE equivocation proof. The proof
/// of equivocation are the given distinct headers that
/// were signed by the validator and which include the
/// slot number.
pub struct BabeEquivocation<Header, Id> {
	/// Returns the authority id of the equivocator.
	pub offender: Id,
	/// The slot at which the equivocation happened.
	pub slot: Slot,
	/// The first header involved in the equivocation.
	pub first_header: Header,
	/// The second header involved in the equivocation.
	pub second_header: Header,
}
```

</widget-column>
</widget-columns>

---

## Reporting equivocations

Both BABE and GRANDPA runtime pallets include an API for reporting equivocations.

Whenever validators observe an equivocation they create a proof and send an extrinsic to call into `report_equivocation` API.

```rust
pub fn report_equivocation(
	origin: OriginFor<T>,
	equivocation_proof: Box<EquivocationProof<T::Hash, T::BlockNumber>>,
	key_owner_proof: T::KeyOwnerProof,
) -> DispatchResultWithPostInfo {
	// verify proof validity
	// create offence object
	// announce it to the rest of the runtime
}
```

---

## Reporting equivocations

Neither BABE nor GRANDPA are responsible for what to do after an equivocation is reported.
The remaining pallets in the runtime can be notified about the offence and react to it.

E.g. the staking pallet can slash the given validator

```rust
pub fn report_equivocation(
	origin: OriginFor<T>,
	equivocation_proof: Box<EquivocationProof<T::Hash, T::BlockNumber>>,
	key_owner_proof: T::KeyOwnerProof,
) -> DispatchResultWithPostInfo {
	// verify proof validity
	// create offence object
	// announce it to the rest of the runtime
}
```

---

# The end! 🫠

## Finality stalls

Notes:

I might create a slide for this in case the question comes up, otherwise I'll skip it as I think it's already too much material for a single lecture.
