## Host/Runtime Interface

Lecture 4, Module 4

Instructor: Joshy Orndorff, Kian Paimani

---v

The Client / Runtime division is one of the most important design decisions in Substrate.

In this lesson:

- Where is the division (the "wasm boundary")?
- Why did we make this distinction?
- How the two parts communicate with each other

---

## The Substrate Runtime

![Diagram of Substrate Node](../../../assets/img/4-Substrate/4.4-node-diagram.png)

- Inside the boundary, in wasm, is the runtime
- Outside the boundary, in Rust, is the client

Notes:
On the client side, you have:

- P2P networking
- Block database including block storage
- Consensus (Block authoring/Finality)
- Wasm executor
  These are the normal P2P blockchain style tasks. Most chain developers will not want to customize this stuff at all. If you want to, you can. Especially consensus. But you typically won't need to.

---v

### The Runtime _IS_ the STF

Its jobs are:

- Execute entire blocks
- Determine Transaction validity
- Manage state as transactions are executed
- Construct Blocks -- Only some nodes will call this API, but the runtime needs to support it.
- Consensus-adjacent tasks like authority set management
- Data Accessors (possibly with some light post-processing)

Notes:
The first three are really the core jobs. Constructing blocks is a job for miners or validators. It makes sense to do block construction with the runtime because much code will be shared and the runtime itself is what will validate the blocks anyway.
Consensus related tasks are really just part of the same state transition logic. Although they can feel "meta" they are equal with token transfers etc.
Jobs like accessing data might seem tangential and redundant. We will talk about them more shortly

---v

### Why make the Runtime distinction?

Two reasons.

1. Separation of concerns
  * Runtime contains the chain's "business logic"
  * Most chains will only want to customize the Runtime
  * This is just good software engineering.

2. But the really compelling reason....

---v

### Runtime Upgrades!

The Runtime can _change_ through the life of the chain.

Analogy you can flash a new program on to your micro-controller. It can even use the same data that is stored on disk and same peripheral hardware. Likewise, you can deploy a new runtime to the blockchain.

This will be covered in much more detail later on. For now, know that it can happen.

## Client - Runtime Communication

<div class="left">

- The runtime uses host functions to get data from the client
- The client uses runtime apis to get data from the runtime
</div>

<div class = "right">

## An Alternate Visualization

![Two way Communication between Client and Runtime](../../../assets/img/4-Substrate/4.4-calling-between-client-and-runtime.png)

---v

## Example: Block Execution

To execute a block, we need both host functions and runtime apis:

- Runtime API: for example `execute_block` - The client provides a block to the runtime, and expects the runtime
  to execute that block.

- Host Function - for example `storage_get` - To execute the block, the runtime will probably need to read
  storage, which only the client has access to.

---v

## Smart Contracts use the same technique

We'll learn more in Lesson 6.5 about pallet contracts

---

## Coding Exercise

<!-- TODO: create the example starter code and work through the entire example. Link both starting point and example solutions. -->

Instructor has pre-written a basic minimal (toy) application that calls into a simple runtime using a simplified interface.
It creates a handful of blocks and tracks the state at each block. The initial example runtime does nothing.
Together we write a second runtime that acts as a flipper
Then we write one that acts as an adder.

---v

Exercise: make it so you can only add if you are adding at least 10% of the current accumulated value.

---v

Exercise: Write one that acts as an adder and subtracter. Add more operations as well like multiply, mod, whatever you want. This introduces the idea of transaction types.

---v

Exercise: Write one that has both the flipper and adder functionality. They should be orthogonal. Now you must keep track of multiple pieces of state.

---v

## Regroup after the Exercises

Instructor demonstrates how we can swap the runtime part way through.

Discussion points:

- Are these runtimes economically secure? <!-- no, there are no fees at all, nor prioritization -->
- Is the adder secure other than the fee part? <!-- no, it can overflow -->

---

## Substrate Runtime APIs

Some [existing runtime APIs](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template/blob/main/runtime/src/lib.rs#L334) in Substrate include:

- Core - most important - for executing blocks
- TxQueue - tells the offchain code whether a transaction is valid and how to prioritize it.
- BlockBuilder - critical for authoring nodes - for writing blocks
- Metadata - we won't use it much today - to teach offchain tools the structure of your storage and extrinsics
- Session Keys - Allow the runtime to generate cryptographic keys that will be used on the client side
- Consensus related - Aura, Babe, Grandpa, PoW all have their own - allows fetching consensus info from the runtime
- Accessors - Many pallets will provide simple "getters" to obtain storage data. One example is the Aura API that just returns the authorities from storage. Any pallet author can write their own, and often some post-processing is included.

---

## Substrate Host functions

See [some existing host functions](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/master/primitives/io/src/lib.rs) in Substrate:

- crypto and hashing
- io
  - storage
  - print
- allocating memory
- also extensible

## Opaque Types (and round trips)

<div class = "right">
TODO: Diagram of this call passing from the client through the runtime and back to the client before finally returning up the stack.

</div>
<div class= "left">
Question: Why make a roundtrip through the runtime instead of fetching the data directly from storage.
</div>

Notes:
Consider this design which is common in Pallets (for example, frontier)
The client calls a runtime API accessor to request some data. The runtime calls a host function to get the data from storage, then returns it.

---v

First answer: You don't _have_ to make the round trip. There is the StorageBackend. (Frontier occasionally uses this _as an optimization_). But you should make the trip because...

---v

### Opaque Types

If the Runtime can change mid-flight, so can its data types.

Some common opaque types:

- `Extrinsic`
- `Block`
- `AcccountId` - if you even have such a type
- Any data structures you store in storage
  - Token values
  - NFT data

Notes:
Since The substrate runtime is upgradeable, the data types it uses can change at any time
The client-side can't make any assumptions about what data types the runtime uses.
When the client is passing around and handling runtime data, it uses scale-encoded data. Just `Vec<u8>`. The client can't interpret the data at all.
Because the client can't interpret even basic data types like transaction, we have to call into the runtime for such things.
This is why we make a round trip through the runtime.

---v

### TransactionPoolApi

Did you ever wonder why the transaction pool logic is in the runtime? The TxPool is offchain. It is not part of the STF. If the runtime is the STF, why wrap TxPool logic into it.

Hopefully you can explain the answer based on the past few slides. Someone volunteer to explain it in your own words.

Notes:
Even the transaction type can change at any time. To the client it is just `Vec<u8>`. In order to validate them and prioritize them, we call into the runtime. The runtime just tells whether it is valid, and assigns a priority. Plus the whole tagged part which you covered in the previous lesson.

---

## More Subtle Considerations

Here are some practical tips and gotchas when extending Runtime APIs and Host Functions

---v

## Speed

- Accessing the Wasm implementation is slower than executing a native function
- Analogy: when contacting host function from Wasm, its like your OS contacting IO buffer

---v

## Missing Host Function

- If you have a runtime which expects a host function which does not exist, or vice versa, the runtime will fail at instantiation.

Note: When the client has a host function the runtime doesn't know of or need, nothing happens.

---v

## Versioning and backwards compatibility

- Host functions are **FOREVER**: when finalizing a block that uses a specific host function, you always need to keep the same host functions.
- Imagine syncing your chain from scratch, every version of your blockchain's runtime will be needed to sync and get to the latest block.
- Thus your client must be able to provide all the host functions expected in the past and for
  present/future blocks.

Note: Distinguish the implications of adding/removing host functions (and the lack of implications when adding runtime api).

---

## Defining a Runtime API

- Use the `impl_runtime_api!` macro.
- No matter the return type, client sees the outcome as `Vec<u8>`.
- Client can always provide extra `at: Option<BlockNumber>`.

---

<div class="left">

- conveniently a Rust trait
- always generic over `Block`.

</div>

<div class="right">

For example:

<pre><code style="font-size: 0.5em !important" data-trim data-noescape data-line-numbers="0-13" class="rust">
/// The `Metadata` api trait that returns metadata for the runtime.
pub trait Metadata {
  /// Returns the metadata of a runtime.
  fn metadata() -> OpaqueMetadata;
}

impl_runtime_api! {
  impl sp_api::Metadata<Block> for Runtime {
    fn metadata() -> OpaqueMetadata {
      OpaqueMetadata::new(Runtime::metadata().into())
    }
  }
}

</prev></code>

</div> 

---v

## Which Runtime APIs are "required"?

Depends on what you are doing.

![Venn Diagram distinguishing APIs that are called 1-on-chain, 2-off-chain, 3-in-development](../../../assets/img/4-Substrate/4.4-Venn.png)

## Cannonical Runtime APIs

These runtime APIs are needed by nodes to operate the live network. They are compiled into the on-chain wasm binary, and the chain breaks without them.

* On-chain ones are called in the block creation or execution flow. Consensus is reached over their results.
* Off-chain ones are called from off-chain contexts and are critical but consensus is not reached over their result.

## Feature gated runtime APIs for development

There are ways to implement runtime interfaces for development purposes, such as:

- Testing and verification: `try_runtime`
- Benchmarking: `frame_benchmarking`

---

## Defining a Host Function

<div class="left">

* use the `#[runtime_interface]` attribute
* just like an ordinary Rust trait

</div>

<div class="right">

For example:

<pre><code style="font-size: 0.5em !important" data-trim data-noescape class="rust">
  #[runtime_interface]
  pub trait Storage {
    /// Returns the data for `key` in the storage or `None` if the key can not be found.
    fn get(&self, key: &[u8]) -> Option<Vec<u8>> {
      self.storage(key).map(|s| s.to_vec())
    }

</prev></code>

</div>

## Coding Activity - Flipper Runtime

In this activity, we will write a Substrate runtime together without using FRAME.

Avoiding FRAME allows us to focus on implementing the Runtime APIs as they are written and use the host functions directly.

As a bonus this sets us up well to say "look how much easier and nicer FRAME is" in module 6.

This code is working in https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template/pull/347

<!-- TODO: Although the code is working, I still need to decide the best order to write each part pedogogically. -->


---v

### Exercise: Adder

Make it an adder like in our toy example earlier.

Bonus points for adding any of the enhancements from earlier:
* make it an adder / multipler.
* make it so you have to add at least 10%
* make it both flipper and adder.

---v

### Exercise: Custom Host Function

Write a custom host function for your runtime. A simple example would be to use a different crypto like RSA or SM2. For an example of using custom crypto host function see https://github.com/hammeWang/substrate-sm2

### Exercise: Custom Runtime Api

Write a custom Runtime Api that fetches the current value of the adder.

As a more realistic example: If you have added the add-at-least-10% feature, this runtime API could return the minimum amount needed to be added next.
