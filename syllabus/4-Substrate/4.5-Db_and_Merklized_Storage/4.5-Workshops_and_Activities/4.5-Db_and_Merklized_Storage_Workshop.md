# Database and Merklized Storage Workshop

The goal of this workshop is to investigate blockchain and Substrate storage behaviours.

Given this diagram, your task is to:

1. Circle nodes that will be pruned when a block is removed.
2. Create a trie which reuses data from old blocks.

TODO: revisit this.
