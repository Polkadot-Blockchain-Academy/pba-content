# Part 1

* This is a big lecture, so I divided it into two small parts, that's all 🫵🏻

## It All Began With a Runtime..

* The Client / Runtime division is one of the most important design decisions in Substrate.

* In some sense, this lecture is a deeper dive into this decision, and its *tradeoffs*.

## Substrate: a short recap

<img style="width: 1200px;" src="../../../assets/img/4-Substrate/dev-4-3-full-comm.svg" />

---v

### Substrate: a short recap

* **Host Functions**: Means of a runtime communicating with its host environment, i.e. the Substrate client.
* **Runtime API**: The well-defined functions that a WASM substrate runtime is providing.

<br>

* Database is a *untyped*, *opaque*, **key-value** storage, stored **per-block**.

---

## Example #1: State

* The runtime wants to add 10 units to Kian's balance.

---v

### Example #1: State

```rust [1-100|1-2|4,5|7,8|10,11|13,14|1-100]
// The runtime decides what key stores kian's balance.
key: Vec<u8> = b"kian_balance".to_vec();

// the runtime reads the raw bytes form that key..
let current_kian_balance_raw: Vec<u8> = host_functions::get(key);

// and needs to know to which type it should be decoded.
let mut current_kian_balance: u128 = current_kian_balance_raw.decode();

// actual logic.
current_kian_balance += 10;

// Encode this again into an opaque byte-array.
let new_balance_encoded: Vec<u8> = next_kian_balance.encode();

// write the encoded bytes again.
host_functions::set(key, new_balance_encoded);
```

---v

### Example #1: State

* 💡 The runtime needs a host function to read/write to state.

```rust
/// a hypothetical set of host functions.
trait HostFunctions {
  fn get(key: Vec<u8>) -> Vec<u8>;
  fn set(key: Vec<u8>, value: Vec<u8>);
}
```

---v

### Example #1: State

> Could the client perform this operation alone?

<div>

* The client does not know where my balance is.
* It does not know which types it has.

</div>

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---v

### Example #1: State

> A small number of well known keys are hardcoded between the substrate client and any runtime. Any
> guesses?

```rust
/// The keys known to the client.
mod well_known_keys {
  const CODE: &[u8] = ...;
}
```

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

> Activity for your entertainment: look them up in `well_known_keys`.

---

## Example #2: Block Import

Now, let's look at another example task that has functions in both client and runtime.


---v

### Example #2: Block Import

```rust [1-100|1-2|4-6|8-9|1-100]
// fetch the block from the outer world. It is opaque.
let opaque_block: Vec<u8> = networking::import_queue::next_block();

// initialize a wasm runtime
let code = database::get(well_known_keys::CODE);
let runtime = wasm::Executor::new(code);

// call into this runtime.
runtime.execute_block(opaque_block);
```

---v

### Example #2: Block Import

* 💡 The client needs a runtime API to ask the runtime to execute the block.
* 🧠 Notice that the api receives an `OpaqueBlock` but works on `RuntimeBlock`.

```rust
/// Some known type in the runtime.
type RuntimeBlock = ...;

/// More host functions
trait RuntimeApis {
  fn execute_block(opaque_block: OpaqueBlock) -> Result<_, _> {
    let block: RuntimeBlock = opaque_block.decode();
    block.execute_and_stuff();
    ...
  }
}
```

---v

### Example #2: Block Import

> Question: Why is the block also opaque in the client?

```rust
// Client's rough view on the block type.
struct ClientBlock<H: Header> {
    header: H,
    extrinsics: Vec<Vec<u8>>,
}

trait Header {
    type Number;
    type Hash;
    fn number() -> Self::Number;
    fn parent_hash() -> Self::Hash;
    ...
}
```

* An extrinsic is a parent type for all transaction types.

---v

### Definition: Extrinsic

> An Extrinsic is data that come from outside of the runtime.

Yes, transactions are **a type of extrinsic**, but not all extrinsics are transactions.

<hr />

- **Signed** Extrinsics (--> what you typically call "_transaction_")
- **Unsigned** Extrinsics
- **Inherent** Extrinsics


---v

### Example #2: Block Import

* And what would be a `RuntimeBlock`?

```rust
struct Header { .. }
struct Extrinsic = { .. }

struct RuntimeBlock {
  header: Header,
  extrinsics: Vec<Extrinsic>,
}
```


NOTE:

Notice that the header type itself can still be generic, but it needs to fulfill some requirements
of a header trait, such as having parent hash.

Most of the block is only decodable in the runtime. Why? Because the block encodes
extrinsics/transaction. Transactions, are part of the application logic of the blockchain and can
change, when a runtime changes. So, the same rules that apply to "storage keys" technically apply to
transactions as well. They can change at the same abstraction layer, every time that the runtime
changes. Therefore, neither are known to the client.

In reality, the block is partially decoded in the client (up to being splited into `header` and
`extrinsics`).


---v
### Example #2: Block Import

```rust
// fetch the block from the outer world. It is opaque.
let opaque_block: Vec<u8> = networking::import_queue::next_block();
// decode it into the client view, which has a header.
let block: ClientBlock = opaque_block.decode();

// initialize a wasm runtime
let code = database::get(well_known_keys::CODE);
let runtime = wasm::Executor::new(code);

// call into this runtime.
runtime.execute_block(block);
```


---v

### Example #2: Block Import

<div class="flex-container">

<div class="right">
<img style="width: 800px" src="../../../assets/img/4-Substrate/dev-4-1-transition.svg"></img>
</div>

<div class="left">

* But this is actually not an accurate depiction 👎
* which state do we use to fetch the code? Which state do we provide as "host function"?


</div>

</div>

---v

### Example #2: Block Import

```rust
// fetch the block from the outer world. It is opaque.
let opaque_block: Vec<u8> = networking::import_queue::next_block();
// decode it into the client view, which has a header.
let block: ClientBlock = block.decode();

// get the parent
let parent = block.header.parent_hash;
let mut state = database::state_at(parent);

// initialize a wasm runtime FROM THE PARENT `state`!
let code = state::get(well_known_keys::CODE);
let runtime = wasm::Executor::new(code);

// call into this runtime, update `state`.
state.execute_and_apply_changes(|| {
  runtime.execute_block(opaque_block);
});

// create the state of the next_block
database::store_state(opaque_block.header.hash, state)
```

NOTE:

* within these snippets, more or less, everything inside `state.execute` is executed within WASM.

---v

### Example #2: Block Import

* 💡 A runtime API call is only meaningful **when executed at a give block**.
* Based on that:
  * The correct runtime code is loaded.
  * The correct state (and other host functions) is provided.

---v

### Example #2: Block Import

* In reality, you will stumble upon client code like this all the time:

```rust
let block_hash = "0x2134123..";
let input_data = "0x2134123..";

/// To call into a runtime API.
let result = client.api.function_name(input_data, block_hash);
```

* Similarly, almost all RPC operations have an `Option<Hash>` argument.
* I guess it should be clear by now what that means 😎.

---v

### Example #2: Block Import

* But this is even now, still not an accurate depiction 👎.
* Recall that anyone that imports the block should check its state root!

---v

### Example #2: Block Import

```rust [14-22]
// fetch the block from the outer world. It is opaque.
let opaque_block: Vec<u8> = networking::import_queue::next_block();
// decode it into the client view, which has a header.
let block: ClientBlock = block.decode();

// get the parent
let parent = block.header.parent_hash;
let mut state = database::state_at(parent);

// initialize a wasm runtime FROM THE PARENT `state`!
let code = state::get(well_known_keys::CODE);
let runtime = wasm::Executor::new(code);

// call into this runtime, update `state`.
state.execute_and_apply_changes(|| {
  // within this, we probably call into `host_functions::set` a lot.
  runtime.execute_block(opaque_block);

  let new_state_root = host_functions::state_root();
  let claimed_state_root = block.header.state_root;
  assert_eq!(new_state_root, claimed_state_root);
});

// create the state of the next_block
database::store_state(opaque_block.header.hash, state)
```


---v

### Example #2: Block Import

* 🤔 Why is the state root checked inside the runtime?

NOTE:

What happens within the runtime defined what is a valid block. The state root check is merely a part
 of it. A blockchain written with substrate could have a different mechanism here.

---v

### Example #2: Block Import: Recap

<img style="width: 1200px;" src="../../../assets/img/4-Substrate/dev-4-3-import.svg" />

---

## Example #3: Block Authoring

---v

### Example #3: Block Authoring

* Let's first talk about this over the figure!

<img style="width: 1200px;" src="../../../assets/img/4-Substrate/dev-4-3-full.svg" />

---v

### Example #3: Block Authoring

```rust [1-100|1-2|4-5|7-9|11-12|14-100]
// get the best-block, based on whatever consensus rule we have.
let (best_number, best_hash) = consensus::best_block();

// get the latest state.
let mut state = database::state_at(best_hash);

// initialize a wasm runtime.
let code = state::get(well_known_keys::CODE);
let runtime = wasm::Executor::new(code);

// get an empty client block.
let mut block: ClientBlock = Default::default();

// repeatedly apply transactions.
while let Some(next_ext) = transaction_pool_iter::next() {
  state.execute_and_apply_changes(|| {
    runtime.api.apply_extrinsic(next_ext);
  });
  block.extrinsics.push(next_ext);
}

// set the new state root.
block.header.state_root = state.root();
```

NOTE:

* What is the type of `next_ext`? `Vec<u8>`
* Do we actually loop forever until the tx-pool is empty? probably not!

---v

### Example #3: Block Authoring

* Substrate based runtimes are allowed to perform some operations at the beginning and end of each block.

---v

### Example #3: Block Authoring

```rust [11-100]
// get the best-block, based on whatever consensus rule we have.
let (best_number, best_hash) = consensus::best_block();

// get the latest state.
let mut state = database::state_at(best_hash);

// initialize a wasm runtime.
let code = state::get(well_known_keys::CODE);
let runtime = wasm::Executor::new(code);

// get an empty client block.
let mut block: ClientBlock = Default::default();

// tell this runtime that you wish to start a new block.
runtime.api.initialize_block(best_number + 1);

// repeatedly apply transactions.
while let Some(next_ext) = transaction_pool_iter::next() {
  state.execute_and_apply_changes(|| {
    runtime.api.apply_extrinsic(next_ext);
  });
  block.extrinsics.push(next_ext);
}

// tell the runtime that we are done.
runtime.api.finalize_block();

// set the new state root.
block.header.state_root = state.root();
```

---v

### Example #3: Block Authoring

* 🧠 new runtime APIs that we concluded.

```rust
trait RuntimeApis {
  fn initialize_block(..) { ... }
  // note the opaque type.
  fn apply_extrinsic(ext: Vec<u8>) -> Result<_, _> { ... }
  fn finalize_block(..) { ... }
}
```

---

## Example #4: Runtime Upgrade

* Finally, a runtime upgrade is really just another transaction, that as a side-effect, updates that
hardcoded key where the code is supposed to be stored.

---v

### Example #4: Runtime Upgrade

<img style="width: 1200px;" src="../../../assets/img/4-Substrate/dev-4-3-upgrade.svg" />

---v

### Example #4: Runtime Upgrade

* Halfway through block `n`, an extrinsic changes `:code`.
* Will the runtime be upgraded for the rest of this block?

NOTE:

No, beginning of next block. Because `execute_block` is one runtime api call. the runtime is upgraded. And in block building, the client mimics the same and makes sure to load the old code (double check, I am not 100% sure).

---

## Recap of Interactions Learned:

* State Update
* Block Import
* Block Authoring
* Code Upgrade

<br>
<hr>

* A few items that you have not learned about, but worth a moment of explanation:

  * Transaction Pool Validation
  * Version
  * Offchain Workers

---

## BUT WAIT A FUCKING MINUTE 😱

* if the code changes, all the following can also change:

1. What state key is kian's balance.
2. What block/extrinsic format is valid.

* How on earth is an application (i.e. a wallet) is supposed to survive?

---v

### BUT WAIT A FUCKING MINUTE 😱

* Metadata 🎉

```rust
trait RuntimeApis {
  fn metadata() -> Vec<u8> { ... }
}
```

* Combined with the fact that every runtime API is tied to the runtime code of a given block.
* Two different wasm blobs in block `N` and `N+1` return different values in this function.

NOTE:

Some personal rant: radical upgradability is the biggest advantage, and arguably one of the main
developability problems of the substrate ecosystem. Writing clients, such as block explorers,
scanners, and even exchange integration are orders of magnitude harder than a blockchain that has a
fixed format and only changes every 18 months at most. That being said, this is a battle that is to
me a no-brainer, and we simply HAVE to win. When ethereum first introduced smart contracts, everyone
probably had the same class of issues. This is the same matter, on a a different level.

---

## PHEW. That Was a Close One 😮‍💨

* The underlying reason why the client is "**kept in the dark**" is so that it wouldn't need to care about the runtime upgrading from one block to the other.

<br>

### THEREFORE:

* Client does not know **storage layout**. It can change!
* Client does not know the internal **extrinsic/block format**. It can change!
* Client does not know how **blocks are executed**. It can change!

NOTE:

This is why forkless upgrades are possible in substrate.

## Substrate: The Full Picture

<img style="width: 1200px;" src="../../../assets/img/4-Substrate/dev-4-3-full.svg" />

---

## Activity: Haunting APIs and Host Functions

---v

### Runtime APIs: The Full List

* look for `impl_runtime_apis! {...}` and `decl_runtime_apis! {...}` macro calls.
  * Try and find the corresponding the client code calling a given api as well.
* Look for `#[runtime_interface]` macro.
* You have 10 minutes!

---v

### Host Functions: The Full List

* Runtime APIs
  * **Core**, **TxQueue**, **BlockBuilder**, **OffchainWorker**, **Metadata**.
  * Sky's the limit! A runtime can expose any more functions through APIs.

> A good definition of an STF is something that implements `Core` API.

---

# Part 2: Advance Topics

* Optional, less abstract, more concrete 😈.

---

## Defining a Runtime API

```rust
// somewhere in common between client/runtime => substrate-primitive.
decl_runtime_apis! {
	pub trait Core {
		fn version() -> RuntimeVersion;
		fn execute_block(block: Block) -> bool;
	}
}

// somewhere in the runtime code.
impl_runtime_apis! {
  impl sp_api::Core<Block> for Runtime {
    fn version() -> RuntimeVersion { /* stuff */ }
    fn execute_block(block: Block) -> bool { /* stuff */ }
  }
}

// somewhere in the client code..
let block_hash = "0xffff...";
let block = Block { ... };
let outcome: Vec<u8> = api.execute_block(block, block_hash).unwrap();
```

---v

### Defining a Runtime API: Takeaways

* All runtime APIs are executed on top of a **specific block**. This is the implicit _at_ parameter.
* Going over the API, **everything is SCALE encoded both ways**:
  * Return type is `Result<Vec<u8>, _>` under the hood. Client needs to know how to decode the inner `Vec<u8>`.
  * Arguments are passed in as `Vec<u8>` or other opaque types.
  * Of course, client needs to encode the right type and pass it in.

> Some substrate abstractions let you pass in typed data into/out of the runtime, don't be surprised
> to see that!

---

## Defining a Host Function

```rust
// somewhere in substrate primitives, almost always `sp_io`.
#[runtime_interface]
pub trait Storage {
  fn get(&self, key: &[u8]) -> Option<Vec<u8>> {...}
  fn get(&self, key: &[u8], value: &[u8]) -> Option<Vec<u8>> {...}
  fn root() -> Vec<u8> {...}
}

#[runtime_interface]
pub trait Hashing {
	fn blake2_128(data: &[u8]) -> [u8; 16] {
		sp_core::hashing::blake2_128(data)
	}
}

// somewhere in substrate runtime
let hashed_value = sp_io::storage::get(b"key")
  .and_then(sp_io::hashing::blake2_128)
  .unwrap();
```

---

## Considerations

---

## Considerations: Speed

#### Native vs WASM

* (new) Wasmtime is near-native 🏎️.
* (old) WASMI is significantly slower 🐢.

> This is why historically, and even now, substrate an optional "native execution" as well, because WASM used to be much slower.


---v

### Considerations: Speed

#### WASM / Host Boundary

<div class="flex-container">
<div class="right">

* Going over the runtime boundary is analogous to your CPU needing to go to memory.
* Host is generally faster, but it has a one-time cost of getting there, and copying the data.
* Also, host has access to more things (state, time etc.)

> Main reason why hashing and crypto is done as host functions.
>
</div>
<div class="left">

<img style="width: 600px;" src="../../../assets/img/4-Substrate/dev-4-3-io.svg" />

</div>
</div>

Notes:

- cost of calling is parameter passing: memory copy: one should strive to reduce the number of call to host function.
- For instance in storage when calculating the root we do not build it in wasm and call the hash host
  function multiple times: we just have a host function doing the root calculation and state trie kept
  in client.

On the other hand things as `next_storage` are high cost (generally iteration on state from runtime
is expensive). This design is related to the memory location, there is alternative but this is
simple (simple as good design).

(iteration remains very costly: because each call to next is going through the host function
boundaries (and historically caching is not supporting it : only get: trade off between code
complexity and performance here)

- Question: we got host function for running computation intensive code in native, but when simd for
  wasm would be added, then will host function for a hashing be still useful:

A: wait and see, but is possible that simd optimization of the hash function in wasm is way faster.

Again using a host function for speed up needs to be reasoned, cost of transmitting parameter in
wasm can be bigger than the actual hashing cost.


---

### Consideration: Native Runtime

<img style="width: 1200px;" src="../../../assets/img/4-Substrate/dev-4-3-native.svg" />

---v

### Consideration: Native Runtime

* Remember the `fn version()` in `Core` API!

```rust [1-100|4-5]
/// Runtime version.
#[sp_version::runtime_version]
pub const VERSION: RuntimeVersion = RuntimeVersion {
	spec_name: create_runtime_str!("node"),
	spec_version: 268,

	impl_name: create_runtime_str!("substrate-node"),
	impl_version: 0,
	authoring_version: 10,
	apis: RUNTIME_API_VERSIONS,
	transaction_version: 2,
	state_version: 1,
};
```

---v

### Consideration: Native Runtime

* Native is only an option if spec versions match!

```rust
fn execute_native_else_wasm() {
  let native_version = runtime::native::api::version();
  let wasm_version = runtime::wasm::api::version();

  // if spec name and version match.
  if native_version == wasm_version {
    runtime::native::execute();
  } else {
    runtime::wasm::execute();
  }
}
```

---v

### Consideration: Native Runtime

* The days of native runtime are numbered 💀.
* Question: what happens if you upgrade your runtime, but forget to bump the spec version?

NOTE:

If everyone is executing wasm, technically nothing, but that's super confusing, don't do it.
But, if some are executing native, then you will have a consensus error.

---v

## Speaking of Versions..

* Make sure you understand the difference! 👍
* Node/Client Version
* Runtime Version

---

## Considerations: Panic

* What if any of the runtime calls, like `execute_block` or `apply_extrinsic` panics 😱?

NOTE:

The rule of thumb is: A panic will cause the wasm execution environment to be immediately
terminated, and any state change is dropped aka. reverted.

While you might think the state revert is the good thing here, it is the main problem, and the main
reason you should not let a code-path that is accessible by arbitrary users to panic. Because, any
fees paid for the wasted execution of that runtime API call is also reverted.

In other words, a panic in the runtime typically allows everyone's time to be wasted, for free,
indefinitely. In other words, a DOS vector.

> A panic in `initialize_block` and `finalize_block` have even more catastrophic effects, which will
> be discussed further in the FRAME section.

TODO: workshop: make a panicing runtime, and DoS it out.

---v

### Considerations: Panic

* Panic in a user-callable code path is typically abusable 😠.
* Panic on "automatic" part of your blockchain like `initialize_block` are deadly 💀.

---

### Consideration: Adding Host Function


* A runtime upgrade now requires a new `sp_io::new_stuff::foo()`. Can we do a normal runtime upgrade?

<div>

* Clients need to upgrade first. No more fully forkless upgrade 😢

</div>

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


---v

### Consideration: Breaking a Host Function

* Here's another example, from substrate:

```rust
// old
fn root(&mut self) -> Vec<u8> { .. }

// new
fn root(&mut self, version: StateVersion) -> Vec<u8> { .. }
```

<div>

* 🧠 Same condition: client update first.
* Note that we need to keep the old `root(&mut self)` around as well, for the transition period.

</div>

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<div>

* When can the old host function be deleted?

</div>

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---v
### Host Functions..

## NEED TO BE KEPT FOREVER 😈

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* Optional activity: Go to the substrate repo, and find PRs that have altered host functions, and see the PR discussion. There are a few labels that help you find such PRs 😉.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


---

### Consideration: Runtime API Versioning

* Same principle, but generally easier to deal with.
* The runtime API is defined in the metadata (soon™️).
* Metadata is part of the runtime, known **per block**.
* Those written in a dynamically typed languages are usually fine 😎.

---v

### Consideration: Runtime API Versioning

* The Rust code (which is **statically** typed) in substrate client does care if the change *is breaking*.
  *  For example, input/output types change. Rust code cannot deal with that!

---v

### Consideration: Runtime API Versioning

```rust
sp_api::decl_runtime_apis! {
    // latest version
    fn foo() -> u32;

    // old version
    #[changed_in(4)]
    fn foo() -> u64;
}

let new_return_type = if api.version < 4 {
    // this weird function name is generated by decl_runtime_apis!
    let old_return_type = api.foo_before_version_4();
    // somehow convert it. don't care
    old_return_type.try_into().unwrap()
} else {
    api.foo()
}
```

---v

### Consideration: Runtime API Versioning

> Rule of thumb: Every time you change the signature of a host function / runtime API, i.e. change
> the input/output types, you need to think about this.

But what you have to do is dependent on the scenario.

---

## Activity: API Versioning

* Look into substrate and find all instances of `#[changed_in(_)]` macro to detect runtime api version.
* Then see if/how this is being used in the client code.

<br>

* Find all the `#[version]` macros in `sp-io` to find all the versioned host functions.

<hr>

* You have only 15 minutes!

### Activity: Frame-less Runtime

* We have prepared a FRAME-less runtime. Let's walk over it a bit.
* It does, by all means nothing.

---v

### A Peek Into the Substrate Storage

* In Substrate, a type needs to provide the environment in which host functions are provided, and
  can be executed.

> We call this an "externality environment", represented by `trait Externalities`.

```rust
SomeExternalities.execute_with(|| {
    let x = sp_io::storage::get(b"foo");
});
```


---v



### Activity: Frame-less Runtime: Part 1

* Add some variant to your simple extrinsic such that it writes a u32 to a single value onchain.
* Track extrinsic root and state root.
* Submit a bunch of extrinsics to set a u32 value, make sure a second node can also sync your chain.
* Which runtime APIs are called in the authoring node and which on the syncing node?

---v

### Activity: Frame-less Runtime: Part 2

* Make your chain upgradable. This sounds scary, but is in reality super simple to do!
* Now change the format of BasicExtrinsic (e.g. u32 -> u128 + bump spec version), upgrade your runtime.
* idea: upgrade your runtime, but forget to bump the spec version. Now try having a node running
  native, and one running wasm, and enjoy seeing the burn in fires.
* Now try and submit a new transaction... can you? This will fail, until you you make the extrinsic type opaque
* Finally, make your runtime have an inherent that sets the timestamp.
