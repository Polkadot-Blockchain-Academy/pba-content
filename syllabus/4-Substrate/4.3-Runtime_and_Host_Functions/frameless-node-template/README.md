# Substrate Frameless Node Template

A stripped down version of the [node template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template), ready for hackin'.

## Coding Activity 1 - Flipper Runtime

We have prepared a FRAME-less runtime.
It does, by all means nothing as it is now.

Try and do as many of the following, in the same order:

1. Make it a flipper: it stores one bool value, and per each transaction, flips that value.
1. Make it an adder: it stores one u32 value, and each transaction specifies a number, which is added to this value and stored onchain again.
1. Extend your transaction so that the runtime can be either an adder or a multiplier.
1. Add a kill-switch to this runtime. Look into well_known_keys to see which key you have to wipe.
1. Make this runtime upgradable! The upgrade operation can simply be protected by a "password" as you don't have any notion of accounts yet.
1. Add a notion of accounts and nonces and signatures.
1. Add a notion of balances
1. Write a custom runtime API, and try to call it over the RPC.
1. Implement a tx-pool api, implement tipping, priority, longevity etc.

.. you can virtually do endless experiments on top of the frameless runtime. Make good ues of it, and you will learn a lot about the fundamentals of substrate!

Moreover, this is the perfect intro to FRAME. You feel the pain of how hard it is to code your own blockchain from scratch ðŸ˜ˆ.

## Build

The `cargo run` command will perform an initial build. Use the following command to build the node
without launching it:

```sh
cargo b -r
```

### Embedded CLI Docs

Once the project has been built, the following command can be used to explore all parameters and
subcommands:

```sh
./target/release/node-template -h
```

### Single-Node Development Chain

This command will start the single-node development chain with non-persistent state:

```bash
./target/release/node-template --dev
```

Purge the development chain's state:

```bash
./target/release/node-template purge-chain --dev
```

Start the development chain with detailed logging:

```bash
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 ./target/release/node-template -ldebug --dev
```

In case of being interested in maintaining the chain's state between runs a base path must be added:

```bash
// Create a folder to use as the db base path
$ mkdir my-chain-state

// Use of that folder to store the chain state
$ ./target/release/node-template --dev --base-path ./my-chain-state/

// Check the folder structure created inside the base path after running the chain
$ ls ./my-chain-state
chains
$ ls ./my-chain-state/chains/
dev
$ ls ./my-chain-state/chains/dev
db keystore network
```
