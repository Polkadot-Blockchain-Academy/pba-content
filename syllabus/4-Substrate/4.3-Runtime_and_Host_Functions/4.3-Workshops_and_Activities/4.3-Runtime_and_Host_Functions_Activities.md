# Runtime and Host Functions Activities

In the previous lesson, you've learnt about how the runtime and client can communicate with each other.

1. Refer to slides to implement your own feature-gated:

- Runtime API
- Host function

2. In lesson 4.2, you learnt a concept called "inherents", which are a special type of extrinisic that a node can make to add data to a block.
   In the context of runtime interfaces, describe how a node produces an inherent for time-stamping blocks.
