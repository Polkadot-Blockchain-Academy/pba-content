## Substrate Storage: Key Value

### Substrate Storage: Key Value

* Recall that at the `sp_io` layer, you have keys and values.

* `sp_io::storage::get(vec![8, 2])`;
* `sp_io::storage::set(vec![2, 9], vec![42, 33])`;


> Database is a *untyped*, *opaque*, **key-value** storage, stored **per-block**.

---v

### Substrate Storage: Key Value

* In Substrate, a type needs to provide the environment in which host functions are provided, and
  can be executed.

> We call this an "externality environment", represented by `trait Externalities`.

By convention, an externality has a "**backend**" that is in charge of dealing with storage.

* How about a key-value storage externality? why not? 🙈

* O(1) Read and write.
* Hash all the data once to get a root.

### Substrate Storage: Key Value

* If alice only has this root, how can I prove to her how much balance she has?

> Alice is representing a light client, I represent a full node.

THE WHOLE FUCKING DATABASE 😱.

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## Substrate Storage: Merklized

* This brings us again to why we like to "merkelize" things.
* We take the key, and make it be the path on a trie.
* Some nodes contain value, some nodes are just "connectors".
* Then we store the nodes of this tree in a database by hashing them.

---v

### Substrate Storage: Merklized

- We know the state-root at a given block `n`.
- assume this is a radix-26, patricia trie. English alphabet is the key-scope.
- Let's see the steps needed to read `balances_alice` from the storage.

## WAIT A FUCKING MINUTE... 🤔

* What if there is a node with a very large value along the path of a proof?

---v

<img style="width: 1000px;" src="../../../assets/img/4-Substrate/dev-trie-backend-proof-fat.svg"></img>

---v

## WAIT A FUCKING MINUTE... 🤔

* Also.. what if I only want to delete a node? should the whole data be in the proof?
* All solved by "`state-version = 1`".
* A new trie "format", in which:
  * All data containing more than 32 bytes are replaced with their hash.
  * Don't care about having big siblings, and easier deletion proofs.

```rust
struct RuntimeVersion {
  ...
  state_version: 0,
}
```

---

### Substrate Storage: *Real* Merklized

* The Trie-node format I showed is a massive simplification.
* Instead of alphabet, we use the base-16 representation of everything.

> Radix 16, Patricia Merkle Tree.

* `System` -> `73797374656d`
* `:code` -> `3a636f646500`

### Unbalanced Tree

<img style="width: 1000px;" src="../../../assets/img/4-Substrate/dev-trie-backend-unbalanced.svg"></img>


---v

### Unbalanced Tree

* Unbalanced tree means unbalanced performance. An attack vector, if done right.
* You as the runtime developer must ensure that you use the right keys.
* This is particularly an issue if an end user can control where they can insert into the trie!

> More about this in FRAME storage, and how it is prevented there


NOTE:

The main prevention is using a cryptographically secure hash function on the frame side.

## Substrate Storage: The Updated Picture

<img style="width: 1000px;" src="../../../assets/img/4-Substrate/dev-storage-3.svg"></img>

---

## Substrate Storage: The Role of FRAME

* All FRAME does is hashing keys, really.
* No seriously, that's almost all it does.


* Done right, the tree should be balanced because of hashing.

## WAIT A FUCKING MINUTE... 🤔


* We should of course think of caching..
* We rarely care about state root and all the trie shenanigans before the end of the block..

> A block-scoped cache for storage.


NOTE:

I am pretty sure that when importing block, we have 1 runtime api call and it has one `Ext` and ergo
one one `Overlay`. When creating a block, I am not sure. Either way, that's not the main point.


---

## Substrate Storage: Overlay

* Is a cache layer.
* It works **based on key-values**, **not trie-format**.
  * Once you read a value, it stays here, and can be re-read for cheap.
  * Once you write a value, it will only be written here.
    * It can be read for cheap.
  * All writes are flushed at the end of the runtime api call.


---v

<img style="width: 1400px;" src="../../../assets/img/4-Substrate/dev-overlay.svg"></img>

<img style="width: 1400px;" src="../../../assets/img/4-Substrate/dev-overlay-1.svg"></img>

---v

<img style="width: 1400px;" src="../../../assets/img/4-Substrate/dev-overlay-3.svg"></img>

---v

### Substrate Storage: Overlay


* Cheap != Free

```rust
let temp = sp_io::storage::get(b"bar");

// is a lot faster!
let cached = sp_io::storage::get(b"bar");
// but not as fast as this!
let in_memory = temp;
```

NOTE:

* A deletion is basically a write.

---v

### Substrate Storage: Overlay

* The overlay is also able to spawn child-overlays, know as "*storage layer*".
* Useful for having a *transactional* block of code.

```rust
// spawn a new layer.
with_storage_layer(|| {
    let foo = sp_io::storage::read(b"foo");
    sp_io::storage::set(b"bar", foo);

    if cond {
        Err("this will be reverted")
    } else {
        Ok("This will be commit to the top overlay")
    }
})
```

NOTE:

- implement with zero-copy. So, the size of values is not so important, it is more about the number.

---v

### Substrate Storage: Overlay

* There is a limit to how many tested layers you can spawn
* It is not free, thus it is attack-able.

```rust
with_storage_layer(|| {
    let foo = sp_io::storage::read(b"foo");
    with_storage_layer(|| {
        sp_io::storage::set(b"foo", b"foo");
        with_storage_layer(|| {
            sp_io::storage::set(b"bar", foo);
            with_storage_layer(|| {
                sp_io::storage::set(b"foo", "damn");
                Err("damn")
            })
            Ok("what")
        })
        Err("the")
    });
    Ok("hell")
})
```

---v

### Substrate Storage: Overlay

> What if I call `sp_io::storage::root()` in the middle of the block?

* Can the overlay respond to this?

NOTE:

NO! overlay works on the level on key-values, ot knows nothing of trie nodes, and to compute the root we have to go to the trie layer and pull a whole lot of data back from the disk and build all the nodes etc. etc.

---v

### Substrate Storage: Word on Caches

* There are more caches in the trie layer as well.
* I am too afraid to talk about them though.

### Substrate Storage: Final Figure

<img style="width: 1200px;" src="../../../assets/img/4-Substrate/dev-storage-full.svg"></img>

---v

### Substrate Storage

There are multiple implementations of `Externalities`:

* [`TestExternalities`](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/sp_state_machine/struct.TestExternalities.html):
  * `Overlay`
  * `TrieDb` with `InMemoryBackend`
* [`Ext`](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/sp_state_machine/struct.Ext.html) (the real thing 🫡)
  * `Overlay`
  * `TrieDb` with a real database being the backend

---v

### Substrate Storage

* Recall: Any code accessing host functions needs to wrapped in something that implements
  `Externalities`

```rust
SomeExternalities.execute_with(|| {
    let x = sp_io::storage::get(b"foo");
});
```

* The error message if you forget about this is amongst the most common in substrate:

```
thread '..' panicked at '`get_version_1` called outside of an Externalities-provided environment.'
```

## Trie Format Matters!

* Recall that in our "trie walking", we took the state root, and got the root node from the DB.
* The state root of any substrate-based chain, including Polkadot, is the hash of the "Trie Node".

> Trie format matters! and therefore it is part of [the polkadot spec](https://spec.polkadot.network).

NOTE:

Meaning, if another client wants to sync polkadot, it should know the details of the trie format.

More comments from emeric on the matter:

```
It is all about access to a given data: for instance to do light client proof you only need a few hierarchy of nodes instead of the full state.
But that was probably not the first concern, I guess it was more "how do you update your state": if you change a single ethereum value, then calculating next root would mean doing a hash of all value in state. Having a trie we only need to recalculate the hash of all parent node of the modified value.
eg a state of two value v1 and v2, updating v2 means calculating hash(V2) and hash(hash(v1) ++ hash(v2)). hash(v1) being stored.
if the state is just the flat hash of all values then updating v2 means calculating hash(v1 ++ v2) which as soon as v1 is bigger than ~ 64 byte is more costy, and with more value the gain is more direct.
```
