- The substrate clients should still have some level of _determinism in their performance_. If
  authority nodes have extremely varied performances, they could start finalizing different forks.

- There have been attempts at writing FRAME alternatives, namely assemblyscript. https://github.com/LimeChain/as-substrate-runtime

- Think about the differences between a runtime and a smart contract.

  - A runtime is in some sense a smart contract as well, but not a user-deployed one.

- Substrate Primitives (`sp-*`), Frame (`frame-*`) and the pallets (`pallets-*`), binaries (`/bin`)
  and all other utilities are licensed under [Apache
  2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).

Substrate Client (`/client/*` / `sc-*`) is licensed under [GPL
v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) with a [classpath linking
exception](https://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/license.html).

- Apache2 allows teams full freedom over what and how they release, and giving licensing clarity to
  commercial teams.

- GPL3 ensures any deeper improvements made to Substrate's core logic (e.g. Substrate's internal
  consensus, crypto or database code) to be contributed back so everyone can benefit.

- Currently, the WASM binary spec v1 is used, read more about the new version here: https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/binary/index.html
