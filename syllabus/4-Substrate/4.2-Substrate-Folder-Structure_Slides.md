## Substrate Folder Structure

* How to look at substrate from ***within***.
  * Mostly relevant when wanting to work on substrate itself.
* How to look at substrate from ***without***.
  * Mostly relevant when wanting to build on top of substrate.

## Substrate Internally

Substrate is roughly composed of 3 parts:

- Client: `./client`: `sc-*`
- FRAME: `./frame`: `frame-*`, `pallet-*`
- Primitives: `./primitives`: `sp-*`


Primitives is the glue between the other two.

> Extra Activity: Go search for some crates based on these prefixes in https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/.

---v

### Substrate Internally: `./client`

* database
* consensus
  * finality
  * block-builder
* networking
* import-queue / tx-queue / mempool

---v

### Substrate Internally: `./primitives`

* crypto primitives
* runtime-api/host-functions
* ...

---v

### Substrate Internally: `./frame`

* modules that compose the runtime.
  * balances/currency (bitcoin)
  * WASM/Solidity smart contracts (Ethereum)
  * transaction-payment
  * staking
  * identity
  * proxy / (onchain) multisig
  * ...

---v

### Substrate Internally

* When looking for the code related to a given topic, this information should help you find it.

<hr>

* Networking? only on `sc-*`
* Database/Storage? Probably in `sc-*` and `sp-*`

---

## Substrate Externally

* How substrate is seen once used by a developer.
* Substrate can be used as a set of *libraries* in a binary package.

---v

### Substrate Externally

* Remember this? this is the node-template layer

<img style="width: 800px;" src="../../../assets/img/4-Substrate/dev-4-1-freedom.svg"/>


NOTE:

A bit of code to build the CI, etc.
A bit of code to build the runtime, with maybe some custom modules.

And the rest is... MAGIC

---v

### Substrate Externally: Examples

* `bin/kitchensink-node`
* `bin/node-template`
* low and behold, the entire `polkadot` repo

## Activity: Exploring Substrate Node Template

* This is your de-facto "substrate starter pack". Clone it, and try and find all the main components
of it, based on the material you have learned so far.

<hr>

* Which set of functions the runtime is exposing (remember the thing called "**Runtime API**"? ðŸ˜‰)?
* Which modules from `frame` are used in the runtime?
* What is the version of the runtime? spec-name/version (you have not learned about this).
* Which RPC endpoints does this node have?
* Which consensus algorithm(s) is it using?
* You have 30 minutes!

NOTE:

I can rephrase this exercise as: reading-alien-code challenge. You have not been taught most of this, but still try to find these items:

## Activity: Compiling Rust to WASM


* Let's make a simple rust crate that compiles to WASM!

---v

### Activity: Compiling Rust to WASM

> A target triple consists of three strings separated by a hyphen, with a possible fourth string at the end preceded by a hyphen.
>
> The first is the **architecture**, the second is the **"vendor"**, the third is the **OS type**, and the optional fourth is environment type.

* `wasm32-unknown-emscripten`: Legacy, provides some kind of `std`-like environment
* `wasm32-unknown-unknown`	âœ“	WebAssembly: Can compile anywhere, can run anywhere, no `std`
* `wasm32-wasi`	âœ“	WebAssembly with WASI

---v

### Activity: Compiling Rust to WASM

* you can use `wasmtime-cli` to execute, and `wasm-gc` to trim your WASM files.
* For each step, try both `wasm32-unknown-unknown` and `wasm32-wasi`.

---v

### Activity: Compiling Rust to WASM

* First, write a WASM function that multiplies a number by 2.
* Then, write a WASM function that prints the current time.
* Then, write a WASM function that writes the result of the multiplication into a file with the current timestamp as the name.
* Finally, write a WASM function that multiplies two `f32` numbers.
* Then, really finally, make a WASM function that divides a number by 0.

> For this last one, you might want to transform your wasm-library crate into a wasm "bin" crate.

---

## Extra Activity: WASM Execution

* Substrate supports two types of WASM execution.
* Find the right crate in substrate repo to find the executors, then look them up online.
* Argue which type of executor should be used for runtimes, and which for smart contracts.
* You have less than 30 minutes!

Notes:

We want students to discover WASMI and Wasmtime, and reserch their differences.

So the key difference here is that the compilation of the code is unsafe because you can attack an
optimizing compiler. You can input some code for compilation that just takes forever to compile
(compiler bombs). There is no difference on safety in the actual execution apart from interpreters
being more simple and hence less likely to have bugs.

So compilation can be safe. But only if you can do it in linear time. And that prevents most
optimizations which makes the produced code slow. And it is questionable and surely depend on the
contract in question whether the compilation time can be recuperated if you need to compile it every
time it is run. When we have fuel metering we could port the code generation of wasmtime to the
runtime and cache the produced native code on-chain. Cause with fuel metering we are immune against
compiler bombs.

Then we could have near native speed for contracts.

Of course we could port the code generation of a linear time compiler to the runtime and have the
same without fuel metering. However, there is none except wasmer. And they were acquired by NEAR. It
was always a shady project but now I don't want to rely on it at all. Everything except wasmtime is
a huge liability.
