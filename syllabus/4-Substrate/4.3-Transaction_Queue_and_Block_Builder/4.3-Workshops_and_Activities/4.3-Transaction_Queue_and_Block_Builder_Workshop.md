# Build a Spam Bot

Spam a transaction pool, taking into account:

- Pre-signing transactions
- Transaction pool size and weird behavior
- Modify mortality and tips
- Incrementing the nonce

# Make your node censor transactions

Modify the code of the substrate node template so that the node will not include transactions of a certain kind. For example maybe censor:
* token transfers to (or from) a specific address
* All transactions from a specific account
* Sudo calls
