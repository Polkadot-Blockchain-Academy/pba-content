# Module 5: Smart Contracts Module

#### Prerequisites:
```
sudo apt install binaryen
rustup component add rust-src --toolchain nightly
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
cargo install dylint-link
cargo install cargo-contract --force
```

## Learning Outcomes

This module introduces students to the concept of smart contracts and how they are a natural extension to the existing field of contracts.
We will learn that computer programs can express formal agreements and act as an efficient and impartial alternative to a court or judge.
We will also understand the importance of running such contracts on a trustworthy platform and see that blockchain can provide such a platform.

## Day 2

#### Morning

ink! The Game (lecturer: Piotr, assisting: Filip)

## Assignments

### Main one

Students will be given a contract with a deliberate vulnerability. They will be tasked with finding it and exploiting. Assignment will be autograded with passing grade when the storage state changes due to the exploit.
- When? End of Day 1
- Deadline for submissions: Next morning after day 2 of the lectures (e.g 7am local time as a cutoff).

### Secondary one

The task is to take one of the examples from the hands-on workshop and modify it to meet new criteria.
The work has to be done both in changing contract's code and in the chain extension implementation (pure Rust, but within FRAME runtime).
Assignment will be autograded with passing grade when the contract behaves as expected.

Same deadlines as the main assignment.

There will be only a small weight of the secondary assignment in the final grade: it is meant for the most curious and ambitious students.
