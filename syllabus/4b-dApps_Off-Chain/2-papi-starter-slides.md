# Polkadot-API

## Getting Started

---

## Polkadot-API

Typescript library to interact with Polkadot-based chains

https://papi.how/

---

## Polkadot-API

- ðŸ’¡ Fully Typed
- ðŸª¶ Light-client first
- ðŸš€ Performant and light-weight
- ðŸ§© Modular

Notes:

Full Typed: Not only the library itself, but the interactions with each chain. It even pulls the interaction docs as JSDocs to show them in intellisense.

## Polkadot-API

```sh
npm install polkadot-api

npx papi add dot -n polkadot
```

Notes:

Let's jump into live demo

- Basics
  - Installing papi
  - Connecting to a chain (westend, will be needed for sending tx)
- Operations
  - Query storage: System.account
  - Runtime call: estimate fees with TransactionPaymentApi.queryInfo
    - Create extrinsic System.remark
  - Constant: Balances.ExistentialDeposit
    - introduce compatibility token

=> Find how much balance does the account holding the sudo key have.
=> Find all the Proxy(any) accounts
=> Find out if some account has configured the maximum amount of proxy delegates.

- Transactions
  - Connect to pjs extension
  - Get signer from extension
  - Submit a System.remark to westend
- Compatibility
  - Remark the meaning of descriptors
  - Show example of connecting to a different chain (polkadot) with the same wnd descriptors
    - System.Remark => works, but throws a payment
    - Sudo => fails
