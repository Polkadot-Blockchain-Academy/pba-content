# Cyclic dependencies

In the Substrate codebase you'll notice that everything is organized into independent separate crates to avoid running into cyclic dependency issues.
Primitive types and traits have been refactored out into their own separate crates, as well as other client and runtime components.

Thankfully, Cargo doesn't allow cyclic dependencies between crates.
This workshop will help you understand what all of this means in practice.

## Steps

1. Create a new Rust project.
1. Create a simple set of crates
1. Make the crates run into a cyclic dependency issue.
1. Refactor your code to fix it.

If you were successful the compiler will give you a `error: cyclic package dependency:` error.
