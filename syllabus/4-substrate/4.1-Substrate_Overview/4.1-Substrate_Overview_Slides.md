# Substrate Overview

In this lecture we'll cover Substrate at a high level, ensuring you are able to:

* Describe the architecture of a Substrate node.
* Navigate the Substrate codebase.
* Justify why Substrate claims to be an extensible, modular framework.

---

## Substrate Architecture

Substrate can be broken down into 2 main components:

* Runtime components: libraries that enable writing the business logic of a node.
* Client components: the networking and consensus layer of your node.

---

At an even higher level, Substrate is: 

1. A Wasm executor - the client execution layer.
2. A Wasm runtime - the runtime execution layer.

---

## What is the Runtime?

The runtime contains all of the business logic for executing the state transition function of the blockchain.

Common State Transitions:

1. Transactions: any valid transaction.
2. Hooks: 
* On-initialize: a mechanism to execute some logic when a block is initialized.
* On-finalize: a mechanism to execute some logic when a block is finalized.

Note: We'll be revisiting these concepts later in this module.

## Wasm

The runtime is always a Wasm binary.

WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine.
Wasm is designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.

The open standards for WebAssembly are developed in a W3C Community Group (that includes representatives from all major browsers) as well as a W3C Working Group.

---

## Why Wasm?

Using a Wasm execution environment provides:
- ..
- ..

However, it means Substrate makes certain assumptions about the runtime.

---

## Wasm Assumptions

 and therefore makes the following assumptions:

- Runtimes can't use `std` libraries
- Max

TODO list all Wasm Assumptions

---

## Runtime Assumptions

To make the runtime Wasm a compatible blockchain state transition function, we also assume:

* It exposes a runtime interface
* It has access to client host functions

---

## Client components

<div class="left">

* Networking - libp2p
* Database - RocksDB or ParityDB
* Transaction queue
* Block production
* Consensus

TODO: Add Diagram of Substrate Client

## Client Assumptions

Like the runtime, the client makes a few assumptions:

* Hardware used to run the node: The performance of two computers are not the same, and blockchains must reach consensus in a similar amount of time.
* Networking : TODO
* others? : TODO

In Polkadot, there is a standard hardware that we expect all nodes to use.
More on this when we touch on Benchmarking.

## Exercise: Navigate the Substrate codebase

<div class="left">

1. Clone and open [Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/)
1. Locate the different components we've just learnt about.

Check out [a visualization of the Substrate codebase](https://octo-repo-visualization.vercel.app/?repo=paritytech%2Fsubstrate) and compare it to [Polkadot's](https://octo-repo-visualization.vercel.app/?repo=paritytech%2Fpolkadot).
Can you tell what parts are unique to Substrate and which are unique to Polkadot? 
</div>

<div class="right">

Noteworthy topics:

1. Identify the `sc-*` crates
2. Identify the `sp-*` crates
3. Rust does not allow cyclic dependencies
4. What is in the:
	- `bin` folder
	- `client` folder
	- `frame` folder
	- `primitives` folder
	- `utils` folder
5. Identify how Substrate is used as a library in Polkadot.

Note: This can be a 10 - 15 min exercise.
