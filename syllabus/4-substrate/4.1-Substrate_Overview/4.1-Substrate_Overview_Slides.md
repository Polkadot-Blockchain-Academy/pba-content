## Substrate Overview

Lecture 1, Module 4

Instructors: Shawn Tabrizi

---- 

At the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

* Describe the high level architecture of a Substrate node.
* Navigate the Substrate codebase.
* Justify why Substrate claims to be an extensible, modular framework.

---

## Substrate Architecture

Substrate can be broken down into 2 main components:

* Runtime components 
    * libraries that enable writing the business logic of a node.
* Client components
    * the networking and consensus layer of a node.

---

At a very high level, a Substrate node has two parts:

1. A Wasm executor - the client execution layer.
2. A Wasm runtime - the runtime execution layer.

Note: About the naming of runtime: its not the traditional sense of "runtime".
---

## What is the Runtime?

The runtime contains all of the business logic for executing the state transition function of the blockchain.

---
### Common State Transitions

1. Transactions: any valid transaction.
2. Hooks
    * On-initialize: a mechanism to execute some logic when a block is initialized.
    * On-finalize: a mechanism to execute some logic when a block is finalized.

Note: We'll be revisiting these concepts later in this module.

---

## Wasm

The runtime is always a Wasm binary.

WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine.
It is a portable compilation target for programming languages, designed to enable the deployment of web client and server applications.

The open standards for WebAssembly are developed in a W3C Community Group (that includes representatives from all major browsers) as well as a W3C Working Group.

---

## Why Wasm?

Using a Wasm execution environment provides:
- TODO
- TODO

However, it means Substrate makes certain assumptions about the runtime.

---

## Wasm Assumptions

- Runtimes can't use `std` libraries
- Max 4 GB size

TODO: list all Wasm Assumptions

---

## Runtime Assumptions

To make the runtime Wasm a compatible blockchain state transition function, we also assume:

* It exposes a runtime interface
* It has access to client host functions

---

## Client components

<div class="left">

* Networking - libp2p
* Database - RocksDB or ParityDB
* Transaction queue
* Block production
* Consensus

TODO: Add Diagram of Substrate Client

---
## Client Assumptions

Like the runtime, the client makes a few assumptions:

* Hardware used to run the node: The performance of two computers are not the same, and blockchains must reach consensus in a similar amount of time.
* Networking : TODO
* others? : TODO

In Polkadot, there is a standard hardware that we expect all nodes to use.
More on this when we touch on Benchmarking.

## Exercise 1

<div class="left">

1. Clone and open [Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/)
1. Locate the different components we've just learnt about.

</div>

<div class="right">

* Identify the `sc-*` crates
* Identify the `sp-*` crates
* Rust does not allow cyclic dependencies
* What is in the:
	- `bin` folder
	- `client` folder
	- `frame` folder
	- `primitives` folder
	- `utils` folder
<div> 

Note: This can be a 10 - 15 min exercise.

---
## Exercise 2

Goal: identify how Substrate is used as a library in Polkadot.

* Check out [a visualization of the Substrate codebase](https://octo-repo-visualization.vercel.app/?repo=paritytech%2Fsubstrate) and compare it to [Polkadot's](https://octo-repo-visualization.vercel.app/?repo=paritytech%2Fpolkadot).
* Can you tell what parts are unique to Substrate and which are unique to Polkadot?


TODO: add this:
--> right now, our substrate runtime assumes the w32-u-u target. That target assumes that a pointer is 32-bit. Therefore the maximum amount of addressable bytes is 4 GiB. There is an extension to wasm spec that will potentially give birth to wasm64-unknown-unknown, but I am not convinced that we need that. 4 GiB ought to be enough for everybody.
