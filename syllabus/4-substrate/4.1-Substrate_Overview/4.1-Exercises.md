# Navigate the Substrate Codebase

In this exercise, students will navigate through the Substrate codebase, and familiarize themselves
with the "lay of the land".

## 1. Browse crates

1. Have students clone and open Substrate
2. [Visualize how the Substrate codebase](https://octo-repo-visualization.vercel.app/?repo=paritytech%2Fsubstrate) is split up and compare it to [Polkadot's](https://octo-repo-visualization.vercel.app/?repo=paritytech%2Fpolkadot)

## Noteworthy Topics

1. `sc-*` prefix
2. `sp-*` prefix
3. Rust does not allow cyclic dependencies
4. what is in the:
	- bin folder
	- client folder
	- frame folder
	- primitives folder
	- utils folder
5. Tie this in with the Polkadot codebase, and how Substrate is used as a library.

## 2. Scavenger Hunt

1. Can you find where Substrate implements fixed point numbers?
2. Can you find where you can add additional RPCs to a Substrate node?
3. Can you find where the macro magic for the runtime interface is defined?

Other ideas:
1. Users create a simple set of crates, where they run into the issue of cyclic dependencies.
