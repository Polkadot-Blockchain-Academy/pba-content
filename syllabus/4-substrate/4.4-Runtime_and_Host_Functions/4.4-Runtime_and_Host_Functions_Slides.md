## Host/Runtime Interface

Lecture 4, Module 4

Instructor: Bastian KÃ¶cher

---v

In this lesson we'll learn about how the client / runtime division in Substrate is one of the most important decisions that Substrate has taken.
Thus, understanding the communication interface between the two is equally important.

---

### What does the runtime interface look like?

<div class="left">
The client and runtime need a way to communicate with eachother:

- The runtime uses host functions to get data from the client
- The client uses runtime apis to get data from the runtime
  </div>

  _TODO: diagram of two way communication between the Runtime api and host functions._

---

## Example: Block Execution

To execute a block, we need both host functions and runtime apis:

- Runtime API: for example `execute_block` - The client provides a block to the runtime, and expects the runtime
  to execute that block.

- Host Function - for example `storage_get` - To execute the block, the runtime will probably need to read
  storage, which only the client has access to.

---

## Runtime APIs

Some [existing runtime APIs]((https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/master/bin/node/runtime/src/lib.rs#L1618) in Substrate include:

- Core
- TxQueue
- BlockBuilder

---

## Host functions

See [some existing host functions](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/master/primitives/io/src/lib.rs) in Substrate:

- crypto and hashing
- io
  - storage
  - print
- allocating memory

---

## Speed

- Wasm interfaces are slow to access
- Analogy: when contacting host function from Wasm, its like your OS contacting IO buffer

TODO

---

## Common errors

What could go wrong?

- If you have a runtime which expects a host function which does not exist, or vice versa, the runtime will fail at instantiation.

Note: When the client has a host function the runtime doesn't know of or need, nothing happens.

---

## Versioning and backwards compatibility

- Host functions are **FOREVER**: when finalizing a block that uses a specific host function, you always need to keep the same host functions.
- Imagine syncing your chain from scratch, every version of your blockchain's runtime will be needed to sync and get to the latest block.
- Thus your client must be able to provide all the host functions expected in the past and for
  present/future blocks.

Note: Distinguish the implications of adding/removing host functions (and the lack of implications when adding runtime api).

---

## Exercise 1

Let's walkthrough the existing host functions / runtime interfaces.

What runtime interface is most commonly used when developing?

---

## Feature gated runtime APIs and host functions

There are ways to implement runtime interfaces for development purposes, such as:

- Testing and verification: `try_runtime`
- Benchmarking: `frame_benchmarking`

Basically anything which should be executed locally (or non-consensus code path), and not on the public network.

## Polkadot Standard Proposals

- How might we introduce a new host function into the Polkadot ecosystem?

## How to write a Runtime API

- Use the `impl_runtime_api!` macro.
- No matter the return type, client sees the outcome as `Vec<u8>`.
- Client can always provide extra `at: Option<BlockNumber>`.

---

<div class="left">

- conveniently a Rust trait
- always generic over `Block`.

</div>

<div class="right">

For example:

<pre><code style="font-size: 0.5em !important" data-trim data-noescape data-line-numbers="0-13" class="rust">
/// The `Metadata` api trait that returns metadata for the runtime.
pub trait Metadata {
  /// Returns the metadata of a runtime.
  fn metadata() -> OpaqueMetadata;
}

impl_runtime_api! {
  impl sp_api::Metadata<Block> for Runtime {
    fn metadata() -> OpaqueMetadata {
      OpaqueMetadata::new(Runtime::metadata().into())
    }
  }
}

</prev></code>

</div> 

---

## How to write a Host Function

<div class="left">

* use the `#[runtime_interface]` attribute
* just like an ordinary Rust trait

</div>

<div class="right">

For example:

<pre><code style="font-size: 0.5em !important" data-trim data-noescape class="rust">
  #[runtime_interface]
  pub trait Storage {
    /// Returns the data for `key` in the storage or `None` if the key can not be found.
    fn get(&self, key: &[u8]) -> Option<Vec<u8>> {
      self.storage(key).map(|s| s.to_vec())
    }

</prev></code>

</div>

## Bonus

* Why the way smart contract functions work is unusual (two-way)
* Instantiating multiple wasm instances

(TODO: see where to fit this section / what to add)
