# Consensus, block authoring and finality

In this lecture, we will learn about BABE, Aura and Grandpa, along with how Substrate uses keys and certificates in its consensus layer.
By the end of this lecture, you will learn how block production and finalization works in Substrate as well as how to overcome/debug common issues related to consensus.

## Prelude

<!-- TODO: Shawn ? -->

---

## High level overview

Generally, two components are necessary for achieving consensus:

1. Block authoring (or construction): the mechanism for nodes to create new blocks.
2. Block finalization: the mechanism to handle forks and choose which chain is the canonical chain.

Substrate ships with two block authoring mechanisms (Aura and BABE) and a finality gadget (GRANDPA) - both separate from each other.

Substrate also ships with a PoW block authoring implementation which we'll briefly look through.

---

### Why separate block production and finality?

* **Efficiency**. Consensus systems that make block production part of the finality process make validators send messages with O(n²) complexity for every single authored block: 
    * By isolating block production in a separate module, we can produce blocks in a much more efficient manner.
    * O(n) for BABE and finalize several blocks in one round.

---

* **No constraints on blocks imports.** GRANDPA only requires that the block production system has:
    * Eventual finalization.
    * Follows the fork choice rule of GRANDPA.
    * Block headers have a pointer to its parent block (ensures that light clients can follow the chain).
    * Different failure bounds.

Note: 
On "different failure bounds": With BFT agreement (GRANDPA) you need 2/3 of the validators to be working in order to make progress, if 1/3 of the validators go offline the system will halt. 
With BABE you only need to have 1 validator online to eventually make progress (although at a slower rate).

---

## Block authoring

With Substrate, there exists two block authoring mechanisms:

* Aura: a slot-based block authoring mechanism, where a known set of authorities takes turns in producing blocks.

* BABE: a slot-based block authoring mechanism, where slot assignment is based on the evaluation of a Verifiable Random Function (VRF).

* Proof of Work: not slot-based, anyone can produce a block at any time, so long as they can solve a computationally challenging problem (typically a hash preimage search).

---

### Aura (authority-round) consensus

Probabilistic finality, constant blocktime. 

How Aura works:

* Authorities are chosen in a round-robin fashion.
* The author is allowed to issue no more than one block during that slot. 

* Pros: easy to implement and launch a chain with block authoring relying on pre-determined authorities.
* Cons: not suitable for live permissionless chains (adversaries can know who the next author is and can use that information to coordinate attacks).

Note: The purpose of Aura is to maintain a list of authorities to use for authoring new blocks. 
This is the mechanism implemented out of the box in the Node Template.

---

### How Aura works (continued):

* A list of authorities `A` are expected to roughly agree on the current time. 
* Time is divided up into discrete slots of `t` seconds each.
* For each slot `s`, the author of that slot is `A[s % |A|]`.

Note: TODO round robin selection diagram.

---

### BABE (Blind Assignment for Blockchain Extension)

BABE is a block production mechanism inspired by the [Ouroboros Praos protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros_(protocol)).

2 layers:

* A slot-based scheduling algorithm using a verifiable random function (VRF).
    * Nobody knows who the slot author is until they prove it.
* A round-robin fallback mechanism.
    * Ensures there will always be a valid slot author.

Note: Read the original Ouroboros Praos paper [here](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/573.pdf).

---

<div class="left">

How BABE works: 

* A known set of validators exist who are authorized to produce blocks.
* Time is broken into epochs, each epoch is a set of slots.
* Each slot can have a primary and secondary author (or “slot leader”). 
* "Primary slot leaders" are assigned randomly (using a VRF).
* When no primary leaders are found, BABE uses a round-robin mechanism to assign "secondary slot leaders".

</div>

<div class="right">

</div>

Note: In Polkadot, one epoch is 4 hours and on Kusama one epoch is only 1 hour.

---

### Primary slot leaders

* The goal is to have validators generate randomness that everyone can agree on.
* Validators must evaluate a verifiable random function (VRF).
* VRFs generate a pseudo-random number along with a proof that it was properly generated.

---

### BABE's VRF

In BABE, the VRF takes the following parameters:

1. An author's private key.
2. An epoch random seed (agreed upon in advance by all nodes).
3. A slot number.

Because no two nodes have the same private key, each node can generate a unique, pseudo-random value for each slot.

---

<div class="left">

![VRF in BABE](/reveal-md/assets/4.6/4.6-vrf-in-babe.png)

</div>

<div class="right">

* Each validator evaluates its VRF for each slot in an epoch.
* For each slot whose output is below some agreed-upon threshold, the validator has the right to author a block as primary block leader for that slot.

</div>

---

### Secondary slot leaders 

How to deal with empty slots?

* BABE implements a round-robin fallback mechanism to ensure that every slot has a _secondary leader_.
* If nobody claims that they are the primary leader at the beginning of the slot, then the secondary will author a block.
* This mechanism guarantees a consistent block time.

---
## Testing environments

Substrate ships with two tools for running chains in a testing environment:

* [Instant Seal](https://docs.substrate.io/rustdocs/latest/sc_consensus_manual_seal/fn.run_instant_seal.html): creates a new block for every transaction imported into the transaction pool.
* [Manual Seal](https://docs.substrate.io/rustdocs/latest/sc_consensus_manual_seal/fn.run_manual_seal.html): listens for rpc calls to seal blocks and create forks.

TODO: cc @SME - Not sure where to leave this slide - perhaps this can be followed by a quick exercise demonstrating manual and instant seal in action?

---
## BABE vs. PoW

In Proof of Work systems:

* Block authoring is neither slot-based nor requires a known authority set.
* Any mining node with the capacity of solving a computationally complex problem can produce a block at any time.
* The difficulty of this problem can be tuned to provide an statistical target block time.

---

Because multiple validators may be able to produce a block during the same slot, forks are more common in BABE than they are in Aura &mdash; even in good network conditions.

Q: So how does Substrate handle forks?

A: A finality gadget!

---

## Block finality 

Generally, there exists two ways to approach block finality:

1. Probabilistically (eventual): such as with proof of work systems, like Bitcoin and Ethereum 1.x.

2. BFT agreement (immediate): Most finality gadgets are variations of, like Grandpa (GHOST-based Recursive ANcestor Deriving Prefix Agreement).

Note: Have a look at [GASPER](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/gasper/) for further reading on Ethereum's PoS consensus mechanism.

---

### GRANDPA

GRANDPA is "deterministic" however, there is no such thing as _true_ determinism.
Ultimately, the GRANDPA algorithm decides which set of state changes is final - agnostic to how blocks are produced (which is handled by BABE or Aura).

---

GRANDPA is:

* Fast: it reaches agreements on _chains_ rather than blocks, speeding up the finalization process, even after long-term network partitioning or other networking failures.

* Ensures block finality: as soon as more than 2/3 of validators attest to a chain containing a certain block, all blocks leading up to that one are finalized at once.

* Secured economically: if an attacker wants to take over the chain, they could try, resulting in over 66% of all network tokens getting slashed.

Note: See the original paper for GRANDPA [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.01560.pdf)

---

### How GRANDPA works

* Finds the highest block number with a sufficient number of votes to be considered final.
    * A node that is designated as the “primary” broadcasts the highest block that it thinks could be final from the previous round.
    *  After waiting for a network delay, each validator broadcasts a “pre-vote” for the highest block that it thinks should be finalized. 

* Chains with the most primary blocks are considered final.
    * If 2/3 of validators are honest, this block should extend the chain that the primary broadcasts. 
    This new chain could be several blocks longer than the last finalized chain.

---

How GRANDPA works (continued): 

* Each validator computes the highest block that can be finalized based on the set of pre-votes. 
If the set of pre-votes extends the last finalized chain, then each validator will cast a “pre-commit” to that chain.

* Each validator waits to receive enough pre-commits to form a commit message on the newly finalized chain.

* GRANDPA supports weighted voting. For example, you could implement GRANDPA on your chain where validators with more stake get more votes.

Note: Source: https://polkadot.network/blog/polkadot-consensus-part-2-grandpa/
In Polkadot all validators have a single, equally weighted vote - an economic decision to prevent small sets of nodes from gaining a large network share.

---

<div class="left">

The black blocks are finalized, and the yellow blocks are not. 
Blocks marked with a "1" are primary blocks; those marked with a "2" are secondary blocks. 
Even though the topmost chain is the longest chain on the latest finalized block, it does not qualify because it has fewer primaries at the time of evaluation than the one below it.

---

![GRANDPA Basics](/reveal-md/assets/4.6/4.6-GRANDPA-basics.png)

Note: GRANDPA figures out which blocks more than 2/3 of nodes have in their chain, and finalizes them. It can also give different nodes different weights. These weights could be determined by amount staked in the protocol. In this diagram, blocks C, B, and A are finalized.

---
## GRANDPA vs. PoW

* PoW gives us probabilistic finality: a block in the past is only as safe as the number of blocks that have been built on top of it.
* As more blocks are built on top of a specific block in a Proof of Work chain, more computational work has been expended behind this particular chain.
* This does not guarantee that the chain containing the block will always remain the agreed-upon chain.

Note: An actor with unlimited resources could potentially build a competing chain and expend enough computational resources to create a chain that did not contain a specific block. 
In such a situation, the longest chain rule employed in Bitcoin and other PoW chains would move to this new chain as the canonical one.

---

## Conflict resolution

* A **safety violation** may occur when two blocks that are in different chains are finalized.
* This implies that at least 1/3 of the validators voted on these two chains.
* GRANDPA has a feature called _accountable safety_ to hold validators accountable for safety violations.

---

Voting on two conflicting chains is called **equivocating**.

GRANDPA detects these "faulty validators" by asking validators the following questions:

1. Why didn’t you consider that one block is final when you voted to finalize the second block?
* Honest validators should answer this with a set of pre-votes or pre-commits for the second round that have a super-majority for the second block.

2. _(assuming that (1) is answered)_ Which pre-votes for the first round have you seen? 
* Honest validators basically rat on other validators and reveal all the votes they received from peers. 
Somewhere in the union of both sets you will discover the validators who voted for the two conflicting chains.

While the _client_ only runs the GRANDPA algorithm, the _runtime_ defines the rules for punishing faulty validators (i.e. when >1/3 of the validators have equivocated).

Note: Specifications for punishing nodes is protocol-specific - Substrates doesn't care - it's in the chain’s business logic, not in the consensus layer.

---

### How can we recover from equivocation?

Scenario: Two different distinct forks have been finalized.

* Some validator casts a double vote (out of incompetence rather than malice).
* Other validators can collect this double vote and report it to the runtime.
* The offending validator will be slashed and the reporting validator will be rewarded.
