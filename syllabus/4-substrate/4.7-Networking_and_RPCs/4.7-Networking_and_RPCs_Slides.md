# Networking & RPCs

After this lecture, you will gain a basic understanding of what goes on in Substrate's networking layer, how it works at a high level, and features that are provided in the case you run into errors or want to extend the default usage of LibP2P.

---

## Why P2P

* Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks enable communication without relying on centralized servers
* Nodes (peers) can share consensus critical information, broadcast transactions or enable other nodes to connect to them

---

## libp2p

* Substrate uses [libp2p](https://libp2p.io/), an open source, modular P2P networking stack by the IPFS community
* [Implemented in Rust](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p)

---
### Why libp2p 

* A generalized toolkit
* Upgradable and backwards compatible
* Enables plug-and-play networking for any distributed application

Note: Like Substrate, libp2p is modular and extensible: with it, you can implement different transports ontop of any Substrate chain. 
It's designed so that you can upgrade any element you want, all while remaining backwards compatible.

---

## Modularity

* Not all projects need to support all protocols
* You can extend libp2p with other protocols
* Libp2p's concept of a "multiaddress" makes this possible

---
### Multiaddress examples: IP address

`/ip4/90.46.231.22/udp/25000`

* Node with IP address `90.46.231.22` 
* Listening on UDP port 25000

---

### Multiaddress examples: WebSocket

`/dnsaddr/example.com/tcp/80/ws`

* Requires using the [WebSocket protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) on top of TCP port 80
* Using DNS to resolve the hostname example.com.

---

* Nodes are _encouraged_ to support a set of common protocols
* ... But not required!

Note: Supporting a set of common protocols is not technically mandatory. This makes it possible to easily experiment with new protocols or new ideas, and to deploy new versions of protocols while still supporting old versions without adding technical debt.

---

## The main libp2p protocols

* [secio](https://docs.rs/libp2p/0.2.1/libp2p/secio/index.html) - responsible for encrypting communications.
* [mplex](https://docs.rs/libp2p/0.2.1/libp2p/mplex/index.html) or [yamux](https://docs.rs/libp2p/0.2.1/libp2p/yamux/index.html) - protocols on top of _secio_ that are responsible for [multiplexing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing).

---

### What is multiplexing?

<div class="left">

* Multiple signals can be sent to multiple devices over a single connection.
* The bandwidth of a single connection can be utilized effectively.
* The signal is then "demultiplexed" to arrive to the target device.

## Other protocols

* Projects are able to define their own networking protocol.

* Common protocols include:
    * [identify](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/tree/master/protocols/identify/src) - allows peers to exchange information about each other (e.g. public keys and known network addresses)
    * [ping](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/blob/master/protocols/ping/src/lib.rs) - a liveness check for peers to quickly see if another peer is online.
    * [Kademlia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia)

Note: These are all used in Substrate.

---

### Substrate-specific P2P networking

Two main crates:

* [`sc_network`](https://docs.substrate.io/rustdocs/latest/sc_network/index.html)
* [`sc_consenus`](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/latest/sc_consensus/)

---

<pre> <code style="font-size: 0.5em !important" data-trim data-noescape class="rust">

use sc_consensus::{
	block_import::{
		BlockCheckParams, BlockImport, BlockImportParams, ForkChoiceStrategy, ImportResult,
		StateAction,
	},
	import_queue::{BasicQueue, BoxJustificationImport, DefaultImportQueue, Verifier},
};

</code></pre>

Note: Protocols for Substrate built ontop of libp2p include

---

<div class="left">

* Block announces
* Transactions gossip 
* Grandpa gossiping 
* Block requests
* Merkle proof requests

</div> 

<div class="right">

* Storage requests 
* Collation gossiping
* Collation request
* Availability distribution
* Availability retrieval
* Statement distribution

## Core Ideas to Convey

- LibP2P
    - Multi-Address
    - Modular and Extensible
- Substrate Networking Protocols
    - We provide abstractions over LibP2P
        - BlockSync
        - Grandpa
        - Polkadot
        - Maybe more?
- Bootnodes
    - Future alternatives

---
## Peers

* A nodeâ€™s identity is represented with the `PeerId` struct
* It uniquely identifies a machine on the network

---

## Peer Behaviors

- Discovery
- Banning

Note: A peer in Substrate has two main types of behaviour: discovery and banning.

---

## Node discovery 

* Nodes need to know a list of nodes to join (identities and their address)
* Building this list is called the **discovery mechanism**

Note: In order for our node to join a peer-to-peer network, it has to know a list of nodes that are part of said network.

---

## Discovery mechanism

* Bootstrap nodes: hard-coded node identities for other peers to connect to. 
* mDNS: performs a [UDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol) broadcast on the local network for listening nodes to respond with their identity.
* Kademlia random walk: performs random [Kademlia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia) `FIND_NODE` requests on the configured Kademlia DHTs (one per configured chain protocol) in order for nodes to propagate to us their view of the network.

Note: 
Bootstrap nodes are hard-coded node identities and addresses passed alongside with the network configuration.
