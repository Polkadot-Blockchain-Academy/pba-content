# Block concepts

In this section, we will learn how Substrate interprets a block and what it expects from it.

---

## What is a Block in Substrate?

<div class="left">

A Block in Substrate is just two simple parts:

* The block header
* The block body

</div>

<div class="right">

    ┌──────────────────┐
    │  Block Header    │
    │                  │
    │__________________|
    │                  │
    │   Block Body     │
    │                  │
    │                  │
    └──────────────────┘

</div>
<div class="small-text">
These parts are generally opaque in the client, which gives them minimal assumptions, and maximal flexibility.
</div>

TODO: include a diagram of a block, with just header and body.

## What is the Block Header?

TODO: make diagram - expanded from previous

* State root
* Extrinsic root
* Block number
* Parent hash
* Digests (light clients, author signature etc etc)

---

## What is the Block Body?

TODO: make diagram - expanded from previous.

A block body is simply a collection of opaque data called "extrinsics".

---

## What an Extrinsic really is?

> Extrinsics are data that come from outside of the runtime.

<div class="small-text">
💡 Yes, transactions are a type of extrinsic but not all extrinsics are transactions.

These could be:

* Signed extrinsics: transactions signed and submitted by external accounts.
* Unsigned extrinsics: transactions that don't require a signature submitted by special origins.
* Inherents: data that is provided by block authors.

---

* The client sees all extrinsics as opaque (`Vec<u8>`).
* Contrary, the runtime should decode, interpret, and execute the transactions.

TODO: Diagram to show the flow of transaction from client to runtime, and where it gets executed.

Note: when to use vs. unsigned extrinsics
