## Transaction Queue and Block Builder

Lecture 3, Module 4

Instructor: Shawn Tabrizi

---- 

In this lecture you will learn about the behaviour of the transaction queue in Substrate at higher level (e.g. when interacting with a chain).

---

## Context

<div class="left">

* Transaction are submitted to a transaction pool either externally (by other peers in the network) or locally (by  RPC).
* A gossip protocol propagates transactions to other network participants.
* A block author builds the block which in turn updates the runtime's state transition function.

The pool does a few things:

* It (re)validates transactions when needed and handles:
    * Transaction mortality
    * Priority
    * Banning
* It provides transaction submission and status updates via RPC.

---
## A Generic Transaction Pool

Every blockchain has a transaction pool, however Substrate's is unique in that it makes very little assumptions about what kind of content is in that pool.

* Transactions are just a blob of bytes from the PoV of the pool.
* The transaction pool only knows how to sort transactions by querying the runtime with a runtime API.

---

At a high level, the transaction pool only cares about:

- Satisfying dependencies between a series of transactions and ordering them accordingly (`requires` and `provides`)
- Satisfying transaction priority (`priority`)
- Continuously checking the validity of a transaction (`longevity` and `propagate`)

---
## Transaction source

Substrate's transaction pool implementation makes it possible to apply different validation schemes depending on the source of the transaction. 

Transactions can be received either by:
* The network - gossiped by other peers.
* RPC - submitted locally. 

---

The transaction pool retrieves this information from the runtime using a special type called "Transaction Validity".

<pre><code style="font-size: 0.5em !important" data-trim data-noescape data-line-numbers="1-9" class="rust">

pub type TransactionValidity = Result<ValidTransaction, TransactionValidityError>;

pub struct ValidTransaction {
  pub requires: Vec<TransactionTag>,
  pub provides: Vec<TransactionTag>,
  pub priority: TransactionPriority,
  pub longevity: TransactionLongevity,
  pub propagate: bool,
}

</prev></code>

---

## Transaction ordering 

Transactions are ordered by using:

* "Provides" tags: a set of properties that will be satisfied if the transaction is added to the block.
* "Requires" tags: a set of properties that must be satisfied before the transaction can be included in the block.

This is an efficient way for the runtime to be able to express dependencies between transactions.

---

## Transaction dependencies 

<div class="left">

Transactions with an empty `requires` field have no dependencies and can be added to the next block first.

But for other transactions, the `provides` and `requires` field will create a simple directed acyclic graph (DAG) to satisfy their dependencies.

Then, the series of transactions ready for block inclusion are ordered by `priority`.

</div>

<div class="right">
<pre><code style="font-size: 0.5em !important" data-trim data-noescape data-line-numbers="4-5|6|" class="rust">
pub type TransactionValidity = Result<ValidTransaction, TransactionValidityError>;

pub struct ValidTransaction {
  pub requires: Vec<TransactionTag>,
  pub provides: Vec<TransactionTag>,
  pub priority: TransactionPriority,
  pub longevity: TransactionLongevity,
  pub propagate: bool,
}

</pre></code>
</div>

---

## Priority

`priority` can be any number between `0` (lowest inclusion priority) to `u64::MAX` (highest inclusion priority).

Note: First we need to make sure that all of the transaction requirements are satisfied: we can't simply order transactions in the pool by `priority`.
Once they are, the block author should choose the ones with highest priority first.

--- 
### Longevity

<div class="left">

Longevity describes how long (in blocks) the transaction is expected to be valid. 

</div>

<div class="right">
<pre><code style="font-size: 0.5em !important" data-trim data-noescape data-line-numbers="7" class="rust">
pub type TransactionValidity = Result<ValidTransaction, TransactionValidityError>;

pub struct ValidTransaction {
  pub requires: Vec<TransactionTag>,
  pub provides: Vec<TransactionTag>,
  pub priority: TransactionPriority,
  pub longevity: TransactionLongevity,
  pub propagate: bool,
}
</pre></code>
</div>
