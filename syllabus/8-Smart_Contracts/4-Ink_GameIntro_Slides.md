## The Process

1. üß† Create contract that plays on your behalf<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
1. üöÄ Deploy contract to Rococo testnet <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
1. ü§ù Register contract as player with game contract<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
1. Ô∏èüéÆ We start the game<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
1. üì∫Ô∏èÔ∏è It runs for some minutes, we watch it on screen<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->

## How the Game looks

Notes:

- Your player gets a random color assigned

## How to score?

- Use as little gas as possible to paint as many fields as possible.

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- Stay within your gas budget.

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- The later you manage to still paint a field the better you score.

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## Basic Player Contract

```rust [1-2,19|3-4|7-10|12-17|1-19]
#[ink::contract]
mod player {
    #[ink(storage)]
    pub struct Player {}

    impl Player {
        #[ink(constructor)]
        pub fn new() -> Self {
            Self {}
        }

        /// Called during every game round.
        /// Return `(x, y)` coordinate of pixel you want to color.
        #[ink(message, selector = 0)]
        pub fn your_turn(&self) -> Option<(u32, u32)> {
            Some(1, 2)
        }
    }
}
```

## The Game Contract

> [`ink-workshop/game/lib.rs`](https://github.com/paritytech/ink-workshop/blob/main/game/lib.rs)

- `pub fn submit_turn(&mut self)`

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- `pub fn board(&self) -> Vec<Option<FieldEntry>>`

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- `pub fn gas_budget(&self) -> u64`

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- `pub fn dimensions(&self) -> (u32, u32)`

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## Until Tomorrow üß†

- Find a strategy for your player.<br/><br/>
- Use as little gas as possible to paint as many fields as possible.
- Stay within your gas budget.
- The later you manage to still paint a field, the better you score.<br/><br/>

## How to test locally?

[paritytech/squink-splash-advanced](https://github.com/paritytech/squink-splash-advanced)

---

## Hint: Playfield Dimensions

- Paint within the bounds of the playfield!
- Otherwise you wasted a turn.

---

## Ideas

- You can call your own contract as often as you want!

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- Random number

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- Query which fields are free
  - Query game state via cross-contract call
  - Off-chain computation

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
