1. Code contract that plays on your behalf<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
1. Deploy contract to Rococo testnet <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
1. Register contract as player with game contract<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
1. We start the game<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
1. It runs for some minutes, we watch it on screen<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->

## How to score?

>Use as little gas as possible to paint as many fields as possible.

>The later you manage to still paint a field the better you score.

## Basic Player Contract

```rust [1-21|3-4|7-10|12-17]
#[ink::contract]
mod player {
    #[ink(storage)]
    pub struct Player {}

    impl Player {
        #[ink(constructor)]
        pub fn new() -> Self {
            Self {}
        }

        /// Called during every game round.
        /// Return `(x, y)` coordinate of pixel you want to color.
        #[ink(message, selector = 0)]
        pub fn your_turn(&self) -> Option<(u32, u32)> {
            Some(1, 2)
        }
    }
}
```
