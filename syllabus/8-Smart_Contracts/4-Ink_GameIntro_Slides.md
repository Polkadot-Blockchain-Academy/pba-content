1. Code contract that plays on your behalf<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
1. Deploy contract to Rococo testnet <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
1. Register contract as player with game contract<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
1. We start the game<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
1. It runs for some minutes, we watch it on screen<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->

## How the Game looks

Notes:

- Your player gets a random color assigned

## How to score?

# Use as little gas as possible to paint as many fields as possible.

Use as little gas as possible to paint as many fields as possible while staying within your gas budget. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

The later you manage to still paint a field the better you score. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

## Basic Player Contract

```rust [1-21|3-4|7-10|12-17]
#[ink::contract]
mod player {
    #[ink(storage)]
    pub struct Player {}

    impl Player {
        #[ink(constructor)]
        pub fn new() -> Self {
            Self {}
        }

        /// Called during every game round.
        /// Return `(x, y)` coordinate of pixel you want to color.
        #[ink(message, selector = 0)]
        pub fn your_turn(&self) -> Option<(u32, u32)> {
            Some(1, 2)
        }
    }
}
```

## The Game Contract

- 15 Minutes: Find a strategy for your player
- Use as little gas as possible to paint as many fields as possible.
- The later you manage to still paint a field the better you score.<br/><br/>
- Inspiration:
  - Random numbers?
  - # Query which fields unused?
    [`ink-workshop/game/lib.rs`](https://github.com/paritytech/ink-workshop/blob/main/game/lib.rs)

---

## The Game Contract

- `pub fn submit_turn(&mut self)`
- `pub fn board(&self) -> Vec<Option<FieldEntry>>`
- `pub fn gas_budget(&self) -> u64`

---

## Until Tomorrow ðŸ§ 

- Find a strategy for your player.
- Use as little gas as possible to paint as many fields as possible while staying within your gas budget.
- The later you manage to still paint a field the better you score.<br/><br/>

  - [paritytech/ink-workshop âžœ `game` folder](https://github.com/paritytech/ink-workshop)

## How to test locally

---

## Hint: Playfield Dimensions

- Paint within the bounds of the playfield!
- Otherwise you wasted a turn.

---

## Ideas

- Use a random number
- Query which fields are unused
  - Query game state via cross-contract
  - Off-chain computation

> You can call your own contract as often as you want!
