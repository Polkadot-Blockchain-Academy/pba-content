# Substrate Merklized Storage

---

## What We Know So Far

<img style="width: 900px;" src="./img/dev-storage-1.svg" />

---v

### What We Know So Far

- Recall that at the `sp_io` layer, you have **opaque keys and values**.

- `sp_io::storage::get(vec![8, 2])`;
  - `vec![8, 2]` is a "storage key".
- `sp_io::storage::set(vec![2, 9], vec![42, 33])`;

---v

### What We Know So Far

Nomenclature (with some simplification):

> Environment providing host functions, namely storage ones: "`Externalities` Environment".

Notes:

- In Substrate, a type needs to provide the environment in which host functions are provided, and can be executed.
- We call this an "externality environment", represented by [`trait Externalities`](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/sp_externalities/trait.Externalities.html).
- By convention, an externality has a "**backend**" that is in charge of dealing with storage.

---v

### What We Know So Far

```rust
sp_io::TestExternalities::new_empty().execute_with(|| {
  sp_io::storage::get(..);
});
```

---v

### What We Know So Far

<img style="width: 900px;" src="./img/dev-storage-2.svg" />

---

## Key Value

- How about a key-value storage externality? why not? üôà

---v

### Key Value

<img style="width: 1200px;" src="./img/dev-kv-backend.svg" />

---v

### Key Value

- "_Storage keys_" (whatever you pass to `sp_io::storage`) directly maps to "_database keys_".
- O(1) read and write.
- Hash all the data to get the root.

Notes:

Good time to hammer down what you mean by storage key and what you mean by database key.

literally imagine that in the implementation of `sp_io::storage::set`, we write it to a key-value
database.

---v

### Key Value

- If alice only has this root, how can I prove to her how much balance she has?

SEND HER THE WHOLE DATABASE üò±.

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

Alice is representing a light client, I represent a full node.

---v

### Key Value

- Moreover, if you change a single key-value, we need to re-hash the whole thing again to get the updated state root ü§¶.

---

## Substrate Storage: Merklized

- This brings us again to why blockchain based systems tend to "merkelize" their storage.

---v

### Merklized

> Substrate uses a base-16, (patricia) radix merkle trie.

### Merklized

> Substrate uses a base-16, (patricia) radix merkle trie.

---v

### Merklized

- Substrate does in fact use a key-value based database under the hood..
- In order to store trie nodes, not direct storage keys!

<br>

<div>

- We take the **storage key**, and make it be the path on a trie.

</div>
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<div>

- Then we store the **trie nodes**, referenced by **their hash**, in the main database.

</div>
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

imagine:

sp_io::storage::get(b"ad")

---v

### Merklized

<img style="width: 1400px;" src="./img/dev-trie-backend-simple.svg" />

Notes:

realistically, the storage key is something like `(system_)16`, but I have put the strings here for
simplification.

---

## Trie Walking Example

- We know the state-root at a given block `n`.
- assume this is a base-26, patricia trie. English alphabet is the key-scope.
- Let's see the steps needed to read `balances_alice` from the storage.

---v

---v

<img style="width: 1400px;" src="./img/dev-trie-backend-walk-full.svg" />

---

## Merklized: Proofs

- If alice only has this root, how can I prove to her how much balance she has?

---v

<img style="width: 1400px;" src="./img/dev-trie-backend-proof.svg" />

Notes:

The important point is that for example the whole data under `_system` is not hidden away behind one hash.

Dark blue are the proof, light blue's hashes are present.

Receiver will hash the root node, and check it against a publicly known storage root.

This differs slightly from how actual proof generation might work in the code.

In general, you have a tradeoff: send more data, but require less hashing on Alice, or opposite (this is what we call "compact proof").

---v

### Merklized: Proofs

- üèÜ Small proof size is a big win for light clients, _and_ **Polkadot**.

---

## Merklized: Recap

<div>

- Storage key (whatever you pass to `sp_io`) is the path on the trie.

</div>
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<div>

- Storage key is arbitrary length.
</div>
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<div>

- Intermediary (branch) nodes could contain values.
  - `:code` contains some value, `:code:more` can also contain value.

</div>

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<div>

- Storage Key != Database Key.
- 1 Storage access = Many data base access.

</div>
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

how many database access would do you think it is?

we will explain this in a few slides, but assuming an order `N` tree, and assuming it is balanced,
it will be `O(LOG_n)`.

---

## Base 2, Base 16, Base-26?

- Instead of alphabet, we use the base-16 representation of everything.

> Base-16 (Patricia) Merkle Trie.

- `System` -> `73797374656d`
- `:code` -> `3a636f646500`

---v

### Base 2, Base 16, Base-26?

<img style="width: 1400px;" src="./img/dev-trie-backend-16.svg" />

Tradeoff: "_IO count vs. Node size_"

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Between a light clint and a full node, which one cares more about which?

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

TODO: update figure to represent node size.

Light client cares about node size. When proof is being sent, there is no IO.

First glance, the radix-8 seems better: you will typically have less DB access to reach a key.
For example, with binary, with 3 IO, we can reach only 8 items, but with radix-8 512.

So why should not chose a very wide tree? because the wider you make the tree, the bigger each node
gets, because it has to store more hashes. At some point, this start to screw with both the proof
size and the cost of reading/writing/encoding/decoding all these nodes.

---v

### Base 2, Base 16, Base-26?

- base-2: Small proofs, more nodes.
- base-8: Bigger proofs, less nodes.

‚úÖ 16 has been benchmarked and studies years ago as a good middle-ground.

Notes:

Anyone interested in blockchain and research stuff should look into this.

---

### Unbalanced Tree

<img style="width: 800px;" src="./img/dev-trie-backend-unbalanced.svg" />

---v

### Unbalanced Tree

- Unbalanced tree means unbalanced performance. An attack vector, if done right.
- More about this in FRAME storage, and how it is prevented there.

Notes:

- under-estimate weight/gas etc.
- You as the runtime developer must ensure that you use the right keys.
- This is particularly an issue if an end user can control where they can insert into the trie!
- The main prevention is using a cryptographically secure hash function on the frame side.

---

## WAIT A MINUTE... ü§î

- Two common scenarios that merkle proofs are kinda unfair:
  - If the one of the parent nodes has some large data.
  - If you want to prove the deletion/non-existence of a leaf node.

---v

<img style="width: 1400px;" src="./img/dev-trie-backend-proof-fat.svg" />

---v

## WAIT A MINUTE... ü§î

New "tie format" üåà:

- All data containing more than 32 bytes are replaced with their hash.
- The (larger than 32 bytes) value itself stored in the database under this hash.

```rust
struct RuntimeVersion {
  ...
  state_version: 0,
}
```

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---v

<img style="width: 1400px;" src="./img/dev-trie-backend-proof-fat-fix.svg" />

What is the ramification of this for full nodes, and light clients?

Notes:

TODO: update figure.

Both read and write have an extra step now, but proof are easier.

Note from emeric: the green node is not really a "real" node, it is just `{ value: BIG_STUFF }`
stored in the database. I will skip this detail for the sake of simplicity. One can assume that the
green node is like any other node in the trie.

---

## Substrate Storage: The Updated Picture

<img style="width: 1000px;" src="./img/dev-storage-3.svg" />

---

## WAIT A MINUTE... ü§î

- We rarely care about state root and all the trie shenanigans before the end of the block...

> A block-scoped cache for storage.

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

in other words, one should one care too much about updating a "trie" and all of its hashing details
while the block is still being executed? all of that can be delayed.

---

## Overlay

- Is a cache layer outside of the Runtime.
- It works **based on key-values**, **not trie-format**.

---v

### Overlay

- Almost identical semantic to your CPU cache:
  - <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Once you read a value, it stays here, and can be re-read for cheap.
  - <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Once you write a value, it will only be written here.
    - It can be read for cheap.
  - <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> All writes are flushed at the end of the runtime api call.
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> No race conditions as runtime is single-threaded.

---v

<pba-cols>

<pba-col>

- Cheap != Free

</pba-col>
<pba-col>

<img src="./img/dev-4-3-io.svg" />

</pba-col>

</pba-cols>

Notes:

- In your code, you often have an option to either pass stack variables around, or re-read code from
  `sp-io`. Most often, this is a micro-optimization that won't matter too much, but in general you
  should know that the former is more performant, as won't go the the host at all.
- A deletion is basically a write to `null`.

---v

### Overlay

- The overlay is also able to spawn child-overlays, know as "_storage layer_".
- Useful for having a _transactional_ block of code.

```rust
// spawn a new layer.
with_storage_layer(|| {
    let foo = sp_io::storage::read(b"foo");
    sp_io::storage::set(b"bar", foo);

    if cond {
        Err("this will be reverted")
    } else {
        Ok("This will be commit to the top overlay")
    }
})
```

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

- implement with zero-copy. So, the size of values is not so important, it is more about the number.
- TODO: This `with_storage_layer` is currently in FRAME, but it could technically be in primitives,
  as there is nothing frame specific about it.

---v

<img style="width: 1400px;" src="./img/dev-overlay-nested.svg" />

---v

<img style="width: 1400px;" src="./img/dev-overlay-nested-1.svg" />

---v

### Overlay

- There is a limit to how many nested layers you can spawn
- It is not free, thus it is attack-able.

```rust
with_storage_layer(|| {
    let foo = sp_io::storage::read(b"foo");
    with_storage_layer(|| {
        sp_io::storage::set(b"foo", b"foo");
        with_storage_layer(|| {
            sp_io::storage::set(b"bar", foo);
            with_storage_layer(|| {
                sp_io::storage::set(b"foo", "damn");
                Err("damn")
            })
            Ok("what")
        })
        Err("the")
    });
    Ok("hell")
})
```

---v

### Overlay

- What if I call `sp_io::storage::root()` in the middle of the block?
- Can the overlay respond to this?

Notes:

NO! overlay works on the level on key-values, ot knows nothing of trie nodes, and to compute the
root we have to go to the trie layer and pull a whole lot of data back from the disk and build all
the nodes etc. etc.

---v

### Overlay: More Caches

- There are more caches in the trie layer as well. But outside of the scope of this lecture.

```bash
./substrate --help | grep cache
```

### Substrate Storage: Final Figure

<img style="width: 1000px;" src="./img/dev-storage-full.svg" />

---v

### Substrate Storage

There are multiple implementations of `Externalities`:

- [`TestExternalities`](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/sp_state_machine/struct.TestExternalities.html):
  - `Overlay`
  - `TrieDb` with `InMemoryBackend`
- [`Ext`](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/sp_state_machine/struct.Ext.html) (the real thing ü´°)
  - `Overlay`
  - `TrieDb` with a real database being the backend

---v

### Substrate Storage

- Recall: Any code accessing host functions needs to wrapped in something that implements
  `Externalities`

```rust
// ‚ùå
let x = sp_io::storage::get(b"foo");

// error:
// thread '..' panicked at '`get_version_1` called outside of an Externalities-provided environment.'
```

```rust
// ‚úÖ
SomeExternalities.execute_with(|| {
  let x = sp_io::storage::get(b"foo");
});
```

---

## State Pruning

- Each runtime will think that it has access to **_its_** full state, behind `sp_io::storage`.
- Does the client then store one full trie per-block?

Surely not.

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

- Only trie nodes that are updated from one block to the other are created as new DB Keys.
- For the unchanged ones, we only reference the existing one.

---v

## State Pruning

- üß† Data stored onchain, but rarely changed? De nada.
- State pruning is an _entirely client side optimization_,

---

## Child Trees

<img style="width: 1400px;" src="./img/dev-4-3-child.svg" />

---v

### Child Trees

- Stored on a different DB Column (async-ish bulk deletion).
- Most importantly, alternative trie formats.

---

## Trie Format Matters!

- Recall that in our "trie walking", we took the state root, and got the root node from the DB.
- The state root of any substrate-based chain, including Polkadot, is the hash of the "Trie Node".

> Trie format matters! and therefore it is part of [the polkadot spec](https://spec.polkadot.network).

Notes:

Meaning, if another client wants to sync polkadot, it should know the details of the trie format.

  NO. It might sound like a "but why nooooot" type of situation, but it breaks down all assumptions
  about what a state transition is. The runtime is the state transition function. Recall the formula
  of that, and then you will know why this is not allowed.

From Shawn: my narrative of big_stuff still seems incorrect; 100% double check it before going any
further.
