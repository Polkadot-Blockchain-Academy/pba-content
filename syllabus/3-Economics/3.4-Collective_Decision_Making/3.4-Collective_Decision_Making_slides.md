## Lesson 5: Collective Decision Making (60min)

This section provides an overview of the different mechanisms that can be used in a society to make decisions as a unit.

**Why it is important**
Governance, elections, delegation, etc., are key for the correct functioning of decentralized organizations. In turn, decentralized applications are bringing new innovations and renewed interest to the theory of collective decision making.

**Prerequisites**

- (maybe) read material about types of PoS

**Learning outcomes**
The student will develop basic intuition about NPoS, Polkadot governance, and the reason behind their design choices.

**Learning objectives**

- Learn the most common voting rules
- Learn the most common types of proof-of-stake

**Content**

- What and why?

  - Useful for people to come together and make a collective decision: war, trade, laws, private property, money
  - Example of a village
  - Three main objectives:
    - Legitimacy: notions of fairness, representation, empowerment of people
    - Usefulness: decisions taken are best for society, fast response when needed, etc. (for blockchain: security)
    - Coordination: participation is simple and cheap, process is resource efficient

- Relevance to blockchain

  - Finalizing blocks
  - Functionality updates

- Types:

  - Toy examples (village example)
    - drawing straws (PoW)
    - round robin
    - tyrant, dynasty
    - everyone votes on everything?
  - Delegative systems
    - Minorities (families) elect representatives and they form a parliament
    - Committee election systems
    - NPoS
  - Direct democracy
    - Referendums
    - Binary decisions
    - Non-binary decisions
  - Splits (going from villages to nations)
    - How are minorities defined? Geographical vs political parties vs guilds vs families
    - What if there is division witin a split?
    - Gerrymandering

- Why are some decision-making systems better than others?
  - They can be judged on:
    - Legitimacy/Perceived Fairness
    - Usefulness/Efficacy for the Collective
    - Other Possible Evaluation Criteria:
      - "Decision Quality" as judged by different populations
      - Cost of voting? (getting more people to vote by lowering cost? this leads to more voting and more perceived fairness)
      - Feasability (Operational cost, working within constraints)
      - Security as a mechanism to ensure that 'better' (fairer? more effective?) decisions are made
- In winner-take-all decision making processes, the 'winners' can be chosen by:
  - Random
  - Force
  - Delegated Election
  - Popular Election
- There are both real world and Blockchain examples of each, which we'll discuss in this lesson.

Broad Systems of Decision Making

- Nakomoto Decision Making
- BABE = Nakomoto Decision Making + Delegation, the smaller number of individuals are selected to make a block
-
- Other blockchain and real world collective decision making systems to come

What is voting at heart?

- It's about taking a bunch of economic actors who want or are forced to act as a collective and work as a single economic actor. Aggregating agents.
- We need to have a mechanism for decisions to be made? What mechanisms are available? How do we evaluate them? What are the ramifications of implementation constraints (e.g., decreasing the number of votes needed)?
- Voting is one of many mechanisms to come to a collective decision

What voting is for in the context of Blockchain:

- Individual economic actors that make decisions that govern their own lives. With a collective that has shared resources, they need to make a collective decision; what are the advantages and disadvantages of different ways of making a collective decision?

What's the role of delegation?

- Delegation is a means of simplifying the system, and it comes at a huge cost
  - Reduces accuracy, but makes systems manageable.
  - Now we have ways to implement large-scale voting, so delegation has less of a practical role.
  - Random round robin as a power structure vs. elected delegates
  - Agile delegation
    - Delegating to different people based on what decision there is to be made
  - Elections
  - Parallels with existing government systems

* Voting types: single vote, approval, ranked, weighted voting
* Voting systems: FPTP, STV, committee elections
* Modern alternatives: futarchy, liquid democracy
* **Application to PoS**: relevant types of PoS, NPoS, DPoS, BPoS
  - Fundamental rules: staying agile and avoiding capture
  - How do we evaluate these different systems;
    - Legitimacy (Does the collective feel that the decisions are fair?)
      - Important in the West
    - Benefits the collective (e.g., benevolent dictator whose decisions benefit the collective)
      - Important in Corporate law
  - Current challenges for blockchain: runtime efficiency, security, proportional representation, risk of capture
  - Coin voting
  - Transaction fee signaling systems
  - Mine signaling systems
  - Maximizing the number of economically disaligned actors
  - Secure systems benefits currency price. In an insecure system, people can't trust the system enough to invest...(check this note)
  - AURA is round-robin, so can't be used for the random decision making mechanism; that way, the decision maker would be known in advance.
  - For NPoS, the decision is 'should this block be considered final'- we elect delegates and they come together and use a protocol (GRANDPA) to decide which decision should be final
  - Static delegation to create a smaller number of decision makers, still an extra mechanism used, like
    - majority vote
    - GRANDPA authority
    - Selection of NPoS validators (which in part uses Phragmen)
    - Council (which uses Phragmen)
    - Parliaments (FPTP)
  - Different Way of delegating
    - Liquid Democracy (non-static)
    - Multi-level delegation (heirarchically delegated, elect a parliament, they elect a government, they create the European council)
  - Nakomoto is basically a random selection; chooses a random mining node that solves the nonce (make parellels to the earlier idea about choosing a random person to make the decisions)
  - **Attribute of consensus systems is a collective decison-making machine to decide which transactions happen and in which order**
  - Other challenges: strategic voting, transparency vs privacy, low turnout (paradox of voting)

Governance

- Brief history of governance for social systems
- Types of governance: in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polkadot, DAOs. Off-chain vs. on-chain.
- Decisions made by the systemâ€™s axiom to alter those axioms

Application: NPoS & governance on Polkadot.

- Motions & referenda
- Technical committee
- Phragmen algorithm

### Activity (90-120min): ?

Analyze the different types of PoS as well as the different types of governance on blockchain networks, in terms of: runtime efficiency, ease of use, risk of centralization
