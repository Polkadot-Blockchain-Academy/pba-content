# Why do we learn economic concepts?

![Alt Text](https://media2.giphy.com/media/s239QJIh56sRW/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47zost25fvbhsiygchuw7lumjfd8ixk4gckcahhzja&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g)

In this session we learn about basic economic concepts and how they relate to examples from the blockchain space.

---

- Economic principles are...
  - ... important for daily life.
  - ... important to understand and design blockchain protocols.
- Learning objectives: Building a common understanding of core economic concepts to...
  - ... use in upcoming economics lessons.
  - ... apply to the blockchain space (you are asked to apply the learned concepts in some discussions later).
  - ... help you better understand blockchain protocols and make better decisions in designing them.

# Outline

We will talk about the following concepts:

1. [Demand & Supply](#demand--supply): Market Equilibrium, Decreasing Marginal Utility.
2. [Market Forms](#market-forms): Monopoly and Oligopoly vs. Perfect Competition.
3. [Economics of Specialization](#economics-of-specialization): Comparative Advantage, Opportunity Costs, Gains from Trade.
4. Behavioral Biases: Where human decision making might be different than traditional economic theories expect.

---

## Demand & Supply

- A strong summer at the German Nordsee reduces hotel prices at the Adria, a famous artist dies and her art increases in price.
- Underlying mechanism of the functioning of markets.
- Determines the quantity of produced goods and their market prices.

---

## Why do we discuss this?
- Demand and supply are fundamental to understand market equilibrium.
- Understanding market equilibrium is crucial both,
  - to make sense of what happens in current blockchain markets, and
  - to design new markets.

---

## Demand

- Relation between quantity and price as viewed by consumers.
- Imagine a person with the following demand for ice cream

| Price | Demanded Quantity (Alice) |
| ----- | ------------------------- |
| 0.0   | 12                        |
| 0.50  | 10                        |
| 1.00  | 8                         |
| 1.50  | 6                         |
| 2.00  | 4                         |
| 2.50  | 2                         |
| 3.00  | 0                         |

- Law of demand: When prices increase, quantity demanded of a good (generally) decreases.

---

- A graphical representation of this demand schedule looks as follows:

## From individual Demand to Market demand

| Price | Demanded Quantity (Alice) | Demanded Quantity (Bob) | Market Demand |
| ----- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------- |
| 0.0   | 12                        | 7                       | 19            |
| 0.50  | 10                        | 6                       | 16            |
| 1.00  | 8                         | 5                       | 13            |
| 1.50  | 6                         | 4                       | 10            |
| 2.00  | 4                         | 3                       | 7             |
| 2.50  | 2                         | 2                       | 4             |
| 3.00  | 0                         | 1                       | 1             |

---

### Influences on demand?

- Price (Demand moves along the curve)
- Income
- Price of substitution goods
- Preferences
- Expectations
- Number of consumers

---

### How does it affect the demand curve?

---

## Supply

- Supply is the other side of the market
- Describes the relation between price and production quantity.

| Price | Supply of Ice cream |
| ----- | ------------------- |
| 0.00  | 0                   |
| 0.50  | 0                   |
| 1.00  | 1                   |
| 1.50  | 4                   |
| 2.00  | 7                   |
| 2.50  | 10                  |
| 3.0   | 13                  |

- Law of supply: Ceteris paribus, the supplied quantity increases in the price of a good.

---

### Influences on Supply

- Technology
  - Technological advances reduce the production cost and lead to higher output at the same prices.
- Expectations
  - The produced quantity might depend on the expectation about the future prices of the good.
- Number of Sellers
  - Adding or removing sellers from the market drives the overall supply

---

## Demand meets Supply

- Combining the previous graph of market demand with supply we get:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/obvdHM7.jpg" alt="drawing" style="width:800px;"/>

- What happens when the price is higher than the Eq. Price?
- What if the Quantity is lower than the Eq.Q?
- Moving either supply or demand lead to new Eq.

---

## Market forms

### (Or: why monopoly bad?)

- Typically, economists distinguish between three market forms.
  - Monopoly: One firm, many consumers.
  - Oligopoly: More than one firm, many consumers.
  - Perfect competition: Many firms, many consumers.
- The more competition a firm faces, the less market power it has.
- Market power: ability to affect the price (through choosing a certain production level).

---

## Why do we discuss this?

- The current web2 landscape consists of several firms with a lot of market power in their respective market segment.
- We want to understand, from an economic perspective, why too much market power is not a good thing.

---

## Perfect Competition

- Under perfect competition, there are so many firms that a single firm's production quantity, $q$, does not affect the price, $p$, in the market.
- That is, the firm takes the market price as given and solves: $$\max_q pq - c(q)$$
- Here, $c(q)$ is the cost function of the firm.
- Side node: We usually assume that it is increasing and convex, $c'(q) > 0$, $c''(q)>0$.

---

- The optimal quantity $q$ satisfies $p = c'(q).$
- In the optimum, each firm will set its quantity so that its marginal cost, $c'(q)$, equals the market price.
- This makes sense: The firm produces up to the point where an additional unit costs exactly what it gets for it on the market.

---

## Monopoly

- In a monopoly, the monopolist can affect the price by choosing $q$.
- Suppose market demand is $P(q)$, where $P(q)$ is a decreasing function.
- Then, the problem of the monopolist is $$\max_q P(q)q-c(q).$$

---

- The optimal quantity $q$ satisfies $$P(q)+P'(q)q = c'(q).$$
- This says: marginal revenue equals marginal cost.
- In the optimum, the monopoly produces up to the point where the revenue of an additional unit exactly equals the additional cost of producing it.
- Because demand is decreasing, $P'(q) < 0$, the price is above marginal cost, $P(q) > c'(q)$.

---

## The Problem with Monopoly

- As we have seen, the price is greater than marginal costs, $P^* > c'(q)$.
- There are consumers that would buy additional quantity at a slightly reduced price.
- These consumers would gain additional utility that is just below $P^*$ (because they are ready to buy at a price just below $P^*$).
- On the other hand, the marginal cost describes the additional cost to the monopolist when slightly increasing $q$.

---

- Since the marginal cost is lower than the marginal gain to the consumers, total utility would increase when the monopolist would slightly increase $q$.
- From a utilitarian perspective, total welfare should be maximized in a market. This does not happen in a monopoly.
- The loss in welfare in a monopoly is sometimes referred to as a dead-weight loss.

---

- In other words, monopolies are bad because there are unrealized _gains from trade_!
- Side note:
  - Often monopolies are deemed to be bad because they charge high prices to existing customers.
  - This is _not_ the argument here. Here, monopolies are bad because they prevent potential buyers from buying _at all._
  - Prices merely constitute a transfer. But transfers do not matter for the utilitarian who wants to maximize total welfare.

---

## Oligopolies

- Oligopolies are somewhere between monopolies and perfect competition.
- Because of the competition between firms,
  - prices are lower,
  - quantities higher, and
  - the unrealized gains from trade are lower.

---

## Economics of Specialization

### (or: why trade good?)

> It is the maxim of every prudent master of a family, never to attempt to make at home what it will cost him more to make than to buy. (Adam Smith, 1776)

- In this part, we take a closer look at the following concepts:
  - Comparative advantage.
  - Opportunity costs.
  - Gains from trade.

---

## Why do we discuss this?

- Polkadot allows for specialized blockchains (so-called parachains) to share security and trustless communicate.
- We want to understand, from an economic perspective, the gains that arise from specialization.

---

## The question

- Consider Alice and Bob.
- Both are farmers that can produce meat and potatoes.
- Both are time constrained; i.e., they can only produce for 8 hours per day.
- Alice can produce both more meat and more potatoes per hour.
- Should Alice ever trade with Bob?
- (ALMOST) ALWAYS! The reasons are _opportunity costs_ and _comparative advantages_.

---

|       | Meat     | Potatoes   |
| ----- | -------- | ---------- |
| Alice | 2 hrs/kg | 1 hrs/kg   |
| Bob   | 6 hrs/kg | 1.5 hrs/kg |

- Clearly, Alice has an absolute advantage at both producing meat and potatoes.

---

- We do not know anything about their preferences, but suppose the following:
  - In autarky, both find it optimal to spend half their time producing meat and the other half producing potatoes.
  - Both prefer more of both meat and potatoes to less of both.
- The question is: can they do better by trading (i.e., can they each obtain more meat and more potatoes)?

---

## Autarky

- In autarky,
  - Alice produces 1/2 kg of meat per hour and 1 kg of potatoes per hour.
  - Bob produces 1/6 kg of meat per hour and 2/3 kg of potatoes per hour.
- So, in autarky, per day:
  - Alice produces 2 kg of meat and 4 kg of potatoes.
  - Bob produces 2/3 kg of meat and 8/3 kg of potatoes.

---

## Specialization

- Suppose both _specialize_ to some degree.
  - Bob only produces potatoes.
  - Alice produces meat for 6 hours a day and produces potatoes for 2 hours a day.
- Question: can they divide the jointly produced meat and potatoes so that both are better off than in autarky?

---

- Yes, because the joint production is higher under specialization.
- Under specialization:
  - Total meat produced per day is 3 kg (i.e., more than the 8/3 kg produced in autarky).
  - Total potatoes produced per day is 2 kg (from Alice) and 16/3 kg (from Bob), summing up to 22/3 kg (vs. 20/3 kg in autarky).

---

| | | Meat in Autarky | Potatoes in Autarky | Meat when Specializing | Potatoes when Specializing |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|
|Alice | Produced | 2 kg | 4 kg | 3 kg | 2 kg |
| | Traded | | | -7/8 kg | 2 1/3 kg|
| | Consumed | 2 kg | 4 kg | 2 1/8 kg | 4 1/3 kg |
|
|Bob | Produced | 2/3 kg | 2 2/3 kg | 0 kg | 5 1/3 kg |
| | Traded | | | 7/8 kg | -2 1/3 kg|
| | Consumed | 2/3 kg | 2 2/3 kg | 7/8 kg | 3 kg |


---

## What happened here?

- While Alice has an _absolute advantage_ over Bob in both dimensions, she only has a _comparative advantage_ in one.
- Comparative advantage in producing X = lower opportunity cost of producing X.
- Opportunity cost of producing X = how much of Y could I produce instead?

---

| | Opportunity cost of 1 kg of meat | Opportunity cost of 1 kg of potatoes |
|---|---|---|
|
| Alice | 2 kg of potatoes | 1/2 kg of meat|
| Bob | 4 kg of potatoes| 1/4 kg of meat|


---

## Behavioral Biases

- For a long time economic theory was built on the assumption that their actors were _rational_.
  - No other-regarding preferences.
  - Processes all available information efficiently.
  - Not influenced by emotions.
- This works well in many circumstances (e.g., on an aggregate level or assuming highly rational actors like firms executives)...
  - ... but in many it doesn't.
- Most humans are prone to _Behavioral Biases_ and are influenced by social preferences.

---

- IMPORTANT: Behavior is not random!
- Some prominent examples are:
  - **Confirmation Bias**: Decision makers focus on information that cater to their prior belief / opinion and neglect other information.
  - **Sunk Cost Fallacy**: Instead of cutting losses, decision makers continue to pour resources into a failed endeavour.
  - **Herding Effect**: Heuristic where people follow the crowd without making their own informed decision.
  - **Gambler's Fallacy**: In many situations probabilities of repeated events are independent from each other. Often decision makers fail to understand this.

# Classroom Discussions (30min)

---

## Classroom Discussion 1: Bitcoin Price Chart

- How does this relate to the concept we learned before?

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3OTBT6I.png" alt="drawing" style="width:800px;"/>

Notes:

- Open discussion with students. Answers to expect:
  - Price movement over time. I.e., the result of a Demand & Supply curve over time.
  - There is a shift in demand by expectations, (aggregated) income etc. all the previous factors that we described
  - Interestingly: Here is no shift in Supply if the protocol is seen as the producer of bitcoin!! It is fixed. However, the supply on the market does change.
- This discussion will lead to discussing where the demand of a token comes from.
- If possible: Grab this again in the discussion of inflation (i.e., the supply is increasing but deterministic, especially its independent of price)
- Where does demand come from?
- Why should Bitcoin have value?

---

## Classroom Discussion 2: Monopoly

- We have seen: Monopolists' market power leads to inefficient outcomes.
- In the model we considered, the monopolist chose too low a quantity, which yielded too high a price, and too little trade.
- Web 2.0 is full of firms that have a monopoly-like position in their respective domain:
  - Google,
  - Uber,
  - AirBnb ...
- How do these firms exert their market power, if not over quantities?

Notes: 
* fees (uber, airbnb)
* surge pricing (uber)
* opaque auction mechanism (google in the case of online ads) 


---

## Classroom Discussion 3: Polkadot Parachain Auctions

Note: The following is an introductory slide presented to students.

---

## Polkadot Parachain Auctions

- If you want to obtain a slot for your blockchain on Polkadot, you need to participate in an auction (we will discuss the particular format in lesson 3 of this module).
- Winning a slot means that you get to occupy that slot for given time period.
- The payment rule for the winning bid is a bit special:
  - The winning bid in the auction is locked for the duration of the slot.
  - After the slot runs out, the bid is returned to the bidder.
- So, what are the effective cost of bidding?

Note: Expected answers

- What you really pay with: Opportunity Costs.
- What are these opportunity costs?
  - Staking returns.
  - Returns from using your Dots elsewhere.
- Additional question: why do you think this is done this way?

---

## Classroom Discussion 4: Behavioral Biases

- Discuss where you see behavioral biases that we discussed (or others) you see on yourself or in the crypto market.

Note: Expected answers

- Sunk Cost fallacy: People keep buying tokens that are down to reduce their average prices
- Herding: FOMO (?), Bubble formation
- Gamblers Fallacy:
- Confirmation Bias: People stuck in their community do not inform themselves about other projects and cannot believe that other projects do certain things better

---

# Workshop (70 min)

- Basic Idea: We present learners with a tokenomics design that they should discuss in the economic context.
- Before that, we give a short introduction into
  - what _Tokenomics_ means for crypto projects, and what it contains.
  - Some core concepts: Token inflation, initial token distribution, token utility, staking, etc.

---

(Begin of slides "Tokenomics")

---

## Tokenomics

---

- The tokenomics of a blockchain project are generally distilled in a document of the same name that describes several things:
  - The distribution of tokens at the inception of the project.
  - The evolution of the token base over time.
  - The mechanics of how the tokens can be used.
- From these, it should be possible to deduce the incentives of the different token holders.

---

### Distribution of tokens at the inception of the project.

- Usually the tokens that are created at inception go to:
  - Early investors.
  - Founders, Team, and Advisors.
  - Public (in a token sale, ICO).
  - Treasury.

---

### Evolution of the token base over time.

- In general we may distinguish between inflationary and deflationary token supply.
  - Inflationary supply means increasing supply over time.
  - Deflationary supply means decreasing supply over time.
- The former is achieved if more new tokens are minted than burned, the latter if the converse is true.

---

- Example of an (significantly) inflationary token: TBD
- Example of a deflationary token: TBD
- Example of a token with fixed supply schedule: Bitcoin.

---

- The economics of inflationary/deflationary supply is simple:
  - Token supply is a vertical line. Under inflation is moves to the right over time; under deflation it moves to the left.
  - So, if demand does not change over time, then the price will decrease over time under inflationary supply but increase under deflationary supply.

---

### Mechanics of token usage

- In this part, the tokenomics paper describes what the tokens can actually be used for.
- Usually, this includes:
  - Services provided with the blockchain (e.g., paying fees or deposits).
  - Staking.
  - Governance.
- The utility of a token is a main driver of demand in the long run.

---

## What makes good tokenomics?

- It's all about demand and supply!
- Supply is usually easily measurable/quantifiable based on the emission/burning schedule.
- Demand is a lot trickier. Things to consider are:
  - General use case.
  - Staking.
  - Other yield-generating activities.
  - ...

---

## Now, let's discuss!

- We will hand out tokenomics papers of some existing projects.
- Please read them and discuss in groups what makes them a good/bad project from tokenomics view.
- We will reconvene in 25 minutes and discuss in class.

---

(End of Slides "Tokenomics")

Example 1: Acala's Whitepaper: https://pdfhost.io/v/ZuTIZCEgU_tokenomics_acala

Notes:
- How is Supply & Demand in the IPO phase.
- Which things need to be considered when facing initial demand ?

Example 2: Potentially the mechanism of an algorithmic stable coin such as Terra Luna which heavily relies on demand & supply on their coin. (maybe https://thebittimes.substack.com/p/what-can-other-algorithmic-stablecoins?s=r)

Notes:
- Algorithmic stablecoins are interesting because they mainly play with supply & demand to stabilize the price.


---

## Activities Today & Tomorrow

* Earn points by learning the concepts and apply it  (to new situations) with/against your colleagues
* You have a budget (starting at 0) and all points earned add to the budget
* Each point is valued XX EUR
* The big final: Use points in a real auction with nice prices tomorrow

Notes:
- TODO: Set a value to each point

---

## Cournot Competition

* Economic model
* Firms compete by setting quantities
* Identical product
* Demand always meets supply
* Named after French mathematician Augustin Cournot.

Notes:
- We will play something likes this: https://otree-demo.herokuapp.com/demo/cournot
- Game 1: Cournot Competition with 2 firms (players from the audience) for 10 rounds
- Game 2: Cournot Competition with 10 firms (players from the audience) for 10 rounds
- We will see that Game 2 will be much better for the consumers, illustrating the importance of competition.

---

## Game 1

* Cournot competition
* 2 firms (you play 1 firm!)
* 10 rounds
* Points accumulate and are added to your budget.

---

## Game 2

* Cournot competition
* 10 firms (you play 1 firm!)
* 10 rounds
* Points accumulate and are added to your budget.
