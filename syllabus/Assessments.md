# Assessments

In order to assess students' information retention, thinking patterns, and engagement in the course, we will occasionally administer quizes,tests, or formal projects.

The purpose of the assessments in NOT to assign students grades, rank them, or extrinsically motivate them. We assume that the students in the course are largely self-motivated considering they are spending a month of summer in attendance, and we further motivate them through engaging instructors and course work.

## Morning Quiz

~15 min per day

We open each day of the course with a short (3-5 min) quiz followed by a ~10min discussion of the quiz. I would love to administer these quizes using kahoot.it

The quiz covers:
* Material taught a while ago in the course
* Material taught mroe recently in the course
* Material upcoming in todays lecture
* Fun tangential topics that we don't have time to cover beyond a quick mention

After the quiz is administered, the answers are discussed for everyone's betterment. They are not turned in or graded formally considering students can only be expected to know some of the material. Students are encouraged to share for discussions:
* How they reasoned through a question
* Something they got wrong and learned from
* What they got wrong but still don't get

The quiz and following discussion allows the students and instructors to have a shared understanding of everyones progress, as well as foreshadow the upcoming topics. This technique, known as "formative assessment" can prime students' minds for the upcoming material, make them curious, and encourage them to explore their own intuitions about a topic before receiving the standard course.

## Evening Reflection questions

No class time taken

We close each day by presenting the students with a few homework-style reflection questions. The questions are open ended and students can simply think about them, or, better yet, journal about them. The questions encourage students to zoom out and think big picture about the concepts covered in the days lesson or the past few lessons. Questions can be generic and re-usable, or content-specific:

Example general prompts:
* Pick one major concept from todays lesson, and explain ELI5 it.
* List one thing you realized today that you've never thought about before.
* What idea from today's lesson are you most skeptical about and why?

Exmple content-specific prompts:
* What are the security trade-offs between PoW and PoS consensus?
* If instant fanality prevents forks, why doesn't everyone use it?
* Why did bitcoin use UTXOs instead of accounts? Could / Should ethereum use UTXOs?

## Weekly Projects

~ 3 hours per week

At the end of each week, students will be split into groups and assigned a project. Some weeks each group may be doing the same project, and in others, there may be multiple projects to choose from. In either case there should be some degrees of freedom in the solution space (i.e. not just one correct solution). Students work hackathon-style, primarily self-guided, but with TAs and instructors around to support and mentor at all times. We should provide at least 3 hours at the end of each week for such projects, but possibly more.

Afterward each student group (or maybe a subset of them) should give a presentation. The criteria for the presentation is open ended and the main guidange is that it should be valuable to their classmates somehow. For example they may present:
* The problem and their solution
* The problem and why they failed to solve it
* Something they learned along they way

## Final Project

~ 6 hour one time

In the last week, the weelky project is replaced with a final project which. A single problem will be presented to the class, and student groups form organically. The activity is broken into two phases.

In phase 1, groups discuss solutions to the problem, figure out their design, and maybe start a PoC. Afterwards, each group gives a lightning pitch of their solution. Instructors and other mentors give feedback on the solutions (in the form of a reality show. Imagine Gav as Simon Cowell). Half (or more?) of the groups are disbanded and the students are left to join up with the groups that remain.
