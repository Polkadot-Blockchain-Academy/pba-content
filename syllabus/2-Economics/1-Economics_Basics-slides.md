## Guiding Human Behavior

> An incentive is a bullet, a key:<br/>an often tiny object with astonishing power to change a situation.<br/>-- Steven Levitt --

---

## Understanding Incentives

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Motivate individuals or groups to perform certain actions.</li>
<li class="fragment">Historically, incentives were designed to influence human behavior both on a macroeconomic and microeconomic level.</li>
<li class="fragment">Most commonly, people refer to money, that fall under the umbrella of extrinsic incentives.</li>
<li class="fragment">But not all incentives are monetary!</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## Different Types of Economic Incentives

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">In a workplace setting (microeconomic level), employees are often motivated by various forms of economic incentives:
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Flat Rate: A fixed amount of salary irrespective of performance.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Piece Rate: Pay based on the quantity of output produced.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Bonus: Additional rewards for excellent performance.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Relative Incentives: Rewards relative to the performance of others (competitive incentives).</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## Rationality in Economics

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Economic theories often assume rationality, implying that actors:
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Are primarily driven by monetary gains (payoff maximization).</li>
    <li class="fragment">Act in self-interest.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Have unlimited cognitive resources.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li class="fragment">Remark: In this, all factors can be translated into monetary terms.</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## Incentives often work well

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Interest rates set by central banks.</li>
<li class="fragment">Lower rates: Encourage borrowing and investing.</li>
<li class="fragment">Higher rates: Slow down inflation and stabilize the economy.</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## Incentives can Backfire

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">In India during British rule, the British Government was concerned about the large number of venomous Cobras.
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">They offered a bounty for every dead cobra.</li>
    <li class="fragment">People started to breed cobras at home to sell them.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Once the government stopped the program, breeders released the cobras causing larger numbers than before.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## Goodhart's Law

> When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure

---

## Crowding Out

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">In Haifa (Israel) parents often got their kids late from day care.</li>
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">This caused childcare workers frustration.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Idea: fine parents for getting their kids late.</li>
    <li class="fragment">The program was rolled out in some day cares and not others.</li>
    </ul>
<li class="fragment">Traditional economic theory:</li>
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Less or at least equally many late parents.</li>
    <li class="fragment">BUT: The opposite happened, the number of late parents even increased.</li>
    <li class="fragment">After the fine was abolished, parents still were more late.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li class="fragment">Extrinsic motivation can crowd out intrinsic motivation.</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## The Power of Intrinsic Incentives

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Beyond monetary gain, people are also motivated by intrinsic factors.</li>
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Social preferences (Reciprocity, Fairness, Social Norms, Inequality Aversion, Altruism).</li>
    <li class="fragment">Personal morals, and deeply-held beliefs.</li>
    </ul>
<li class="fragment">Economic models often fail to account for these motivations, leading to unexpected outcomes in real-world applications.</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## From Humans to Automated Agents

<pba-flex center>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">The digital age emphasizes the importance of automated actors in our economic systems.</li>
<li class="fragment">Algorithms and bots, respond to incentives, often financial ones, automatically.</li>
<li class="fragment">This shifts the application of incentives beyond a human context and into the realm of digital systems and automated processes.</li>
</ul>
</pba-flex>

---

## Conclusion

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Incentives continue to be fundamental to interactions in society, whether among humans or between automated systems.</li>
<li class="fragment">As we understand more about incentives in different contexts, we can better design them to influence behavior effectively.</li>
<li class="fragment">Intrinsic motivations remain important, but in certain contexts, like automated systems, monetary incentives also play a significant role.</li>
<li class="fragment">The challenge is to balance these factors to achieve the desired outcomes.</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

## Demand & Supply: The Pillars of Market Equilibrium

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">A common model to help predict and rationalize the price<br/>which emerges from a market.</li>
<li class="fragment">Can be used to (gu)estimate the quantity<br/>of produced goods vs. their market prices.</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## Law of Demand: A Basic Principle

- When prices increase, quantity demanded of a good (generally) decreases.

---

## Visualizing Demand: The Demand Curve

<img rounded style="width:900px" src="./img/2.1-market-demand.png" />

---

## Influences on demand?

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Price (Demand moves along the curve)</li>
<li class="fragment">Size of consumer base</li>
<li class="fragment">Average disposable income of consumer base</li>
<li class="fragment">Price of substitution goods</li>
<li class="fragment">Preferences prevalent within consumer base</li>
<li class="fragment">Expectations prevalent within consumer base</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## Moving the demand curve

<img rounded style="width:1100px" src="./img/2.1-demand-curve.png" />

---

## Law of Supply: The Other Side of the Coin

- If the price of a good increases, the quantity supplied also increases

(because suppliers can make more profit!).

---

## Demand and Supply Interplay: Market Equilibrium

<img rounded style="width: 600px;" src="./img/2.1-supply-and-demand.png" />

- What happens when Price is higher than the Eq. Price?
- What if the Quantity is lower than the Eq. Quantity?
- Moving either supply or demand leads to new Eq.

---

## Elasticity

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Measures how much buyers and sellers respond to changes in market conditions.</li>
<li class="fragment">Sensitivity of quantity demanded or supplied to changes in price.</li>
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">High elasticity: small price changes have large impact on quantity demanded or supplied.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Low elasticity (== inelasticity): price changes do not affect quantity demanded or supplied.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

</div>

---

## Conclusion: The Dynamics of Demand and Supply

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Demand/supply model forces in markets and can be used to estimate equilibrium quantity/price.</li>
<li class="fragment">All other things being equal:
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">demand decreases with increasing price.</li>
    <li class="fragment">supply increases with increasing price.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li class="fragment">There are different factors influencing supply & demand curves.
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Elasticity.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Some shift the equilibrium on the curve.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Others move the entire curves.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## Market forms

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Typically, economists distinguish between three market forms.
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Perfect competition: Many firms, many consumers.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Oligopoly: Few firms, many consumers.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Monopoly: One firm, many consumers.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li class="fragment">The more competition a firm faces, the less market power it has.</li>
<li class="fragment">Market power: ability to affect the price (through choosing a certain production level).</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## Market Form Examples

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Monopoly:
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Postal services in many European countries.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Railway services in many European countries.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li class="fragment">Oligopoly:
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Cloud provider (AWS, Google, ...)</li>
    <li class="fragment">Mobile phone service.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Smartphone OS.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li class="fragment">Perfect Competition:
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Consumer products with low barrier to entry (e.g., kebab stand in Berlin, espresso bar in Italy)</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## Why discuss this?

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Current web2 landscape consists of several firms with a lot of market power in their respective market segment.</li>
<li class="fragment">We want to understand, from an economic perspective, why too much market power is not a good thing.</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## Perfect Competition

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Under perfect competition ...
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">there are so many firms that a single firm's production quantity does not affect market price.</li>
    <li class="fragment">the marginal costs (cost of one additional unit) of production equals the market price.</li>
    <li class="fragment">firms have 0 profit.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## Formation of a Monopoly

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Lack of competition: single seller of the good or service, serves the entire market.</li>
<li class="fragment">Lack of substitutes: there are no similar products that provide the same utility.</li>
<li class="fragment">Market characterized by a high barrier of entry (e.g. big investment, legal restrictions).</li>
<li class="fragment">Monopolist is therefore sole price-setter and serves only to maximize their own profits.</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## Is the Government a Monopoly?

---

## Monopoly: Disadvantages

<pba-flex center>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Higher Prices: they are free to set prices arbitrarily.</li>
<li class="fragment">Inferior Products: there is little incentive to improve the product offered.</li>
<li class="fragment">Price Discrimination: different prices can be charged for different customers (based on their elasticity).</li>
<li class="fragment">This leads to sub-optimal pricing and sub-optimal society welfare: consumers either pay more than they should ("monopolist tax") or are excluded from market.</li>

---

## Example: Antitrust case against Microsoft in 1990s

<pba-flex center>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Microsoft engaged in anti-competitive practices where they intertwined Windows OS with Internet Explorer.</li>
<li class="fragment">A removal of the IE would lead to a "Blue Screen of Death".</li>

---

## Monopoly: Advantages?

---

## Oligopolies

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Oligopolies are somewhere between monopolies and perfect competition.</li>
<li class="fragment">Because of the competition between firms
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">prices are lower, and</li>
    <li class="fragment">overall market participation is higher.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## What did we learn?

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Markets differ in how much market power the firms possess.</li>
<li class="fragment">Economics typically distinguishes between three forms (ordered by increasing market power):
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Perfect competition: many firms in the market.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Oligopoly: few firms in the market.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Monopoly: one firm in the market.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li class="fragment">The monopoly is generally viewed to cause inefficiencies for consumers and for welfare by economists.</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

## Economics of Specialization

#### _(or: why bother trading at all?)_

> It is the maxim of every prudent master of a family, never to attempt to make at home what it will cost him more to make than to buy.<br/>-- Adam Smith, 1776 --

---

## The economic question

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
    <li class="fragment">Empirical puzzle: many countries trade even though one has an absolute advantage in producing many of the traded goods.</li>
    <li class="fragment">E.g., the US is well-equipped to cheaply produce both
        <ul>
            <li class="fragment">complex computer chips, and</li>
            <li class="fragment">agricultural goods (e.g., potatoes).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">However, the US specializes in producing the former and importing many agricultural goods.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Question: Why do countries specialize; why do they trade?</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## Comparative advantage

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
    <li class="fragment">Consider the following example:
        <ul>
            <li class="fragment">Suppose Alice can produce 10kg of meat or 20kg of potatoes per hour.</li>
            <li class="fragment">Suppose Bob can produce 2kg of meat or 10kg of potatoes per hour.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">Alice has an <em>absolute</em> advantage over Bob at producing both goods.
    <li class="fragment">BUT, Alice has only a <em>comparative</em> advantage over Bob at producing meat.
        <ul>
            <li class="fragment">Alice has lower <em>opportunity</em> costs of producing meat (in terms of foregone potatoes).</li>
            <li class="fragment">That is, to produce one kg of meat Alice gives up much less produced potatoes than Bob would.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">By the same observation, Bob has a comparative advantage at producing potatoes.</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## Comparative advantage II

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
    <li class="fragment">If both focus on their comparative advantage, then total welfare is higher than in a situation of autarky!</li>
    <li class="fragment">Why? Specialization!
        <ul>
            <li class="fragment">Suppose both require both meat and potatoes.</li>
            <li class="fragment">Situation A - Autarky: both divide their time equally between producing meat and producing potatoes.</li>
            <li class="fragment">Situation B - Trade: Alice focuses most of her time to produce meat and some to produce potatoes, while Bob focuses only on producing potatoes.</li>
            <li class="fragment">Total production of meat and potatoes is higher in Situation B!</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="fragment"><strong>Specialization result</strong>: With trade, both are better off than in Situation A.</li>
</ul>
</pba-flex>

---

## Situation A: Autarky

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img rounded style="width: 1200px; margin-right: 10px;" src="./img/2.1-comparative-autarky.png" />
</div>

---

## Situation: Focus on Comparative Advantage

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img rounded style="width: 1200px; margin-right: 10px;" src="./img/2.1-comparative-trade.png" />
</div>

---

## Situation: Trade

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img rounded style="width: 1200px; margin-right: 10px;" src="./img/2.1-comparative-betteroff.png" />
</div>

---

## Absolute vs Comparative Advantage

<pba-flex center>
<ul>
    <li class="fragment">Alice can produce both meat and potatoes more efficiently than Bob - this is an absolute advantage.</li>
    <li class="fragment">However, the choice to specialize isn't just about absolute production efficiency.</li>
    <li class="fragment">What matters for trade is which good Alice can produce at a lower opportunity cost - this is comparative advantage.</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## Time: The Ultimate Resource

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Time is the one resource that is uniformly distributed and yet cannot be accumulated or saved for later.</li>
<li class="fragment">It's always moving, never at rest.</li>
<li class="fragment">This unique property of time lends it incredible implications.</li>
<li class="fragment">This concept has big impact in the context of money and finance.</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## The Relationship of Time and Money

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Money now is worth more than the same amount in the future.</li>
<li class="fragment">Why?
    <ul> 
    <li class="fragment">Again, opportunity costs: The money at hand now could be invested, potentially earning more money.</li>
    <li class="fragment">This potential earning capacity bestows more value to present money over future money.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## Present Value: The Value of Now

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Present Value brings some future value back to the present moment.</li>
<li class="fragment">It estimates what value would make you indifferent between getting some value now vs. later.</li>
<li class="fragment">It reflects the worth of a future promise in today's terms, based on the potential earnings we could achieve now.</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## Time Value of Money: A Guiding Principle

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">It underlines the importance of wise decisions today for a brighter tomorrow.</li>
<li class="fragment">It shows that nothing is for free. You always give up something.</li>
<li class="fragment">It's a fundamental cornerstone guiding personal savings, investments, and wide-ranging financial decisions.</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## Behavioral Biases

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Behavioral biases are systematic errors in decision-making when people use mental shortcuts (heuristics) to process information and make judgments.</li>
<li class="fragment">For a long time economic theory was built on the assumption that all actors are <em>rational</em>.
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">No regard for fairness, altruism, equality.</li>
    <li class="fragment">All available information is considered.</li>
    <li class="fragment">No influence of emotions.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li class="fragment">This works well in many circumstances (e.g., on an aggregate level or assuming highly rational actors like firms executives) but in many it doesn't.</li>
<li class="fragment">Most humans are prone to behavioral biases and are influenced by social preferences.</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## Behavioral Economics

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Behavioral economics is mainly concerned with the bounds of rationality of economic agents.</li>
<li class="fragment">Influenced by psychological aspects such as emotions, cognition as well as cultural and societal factors.</li>
<li class="fragment">Psychologist Daniel Kahnemann received the 2002 Nobel Prize for <em>Prospect Theory</em>, a fundamental theory in Behavioral Economics.</li>
<li class="fragment">PT models the fact that individuals assess their losses differently than their gains.</li>
</ul>
</pba-flex>

---

## Behavioral Economics

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment"><strong><em>Behavior is not random!</em></strong></li>
<li class="fragment">Key behavioral biases include:
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment"><strong>Confirmation Bias</strong> - Decision makers focus on information that cater to their prior belief / opinion and neglect other information.</li>
    <li class="fragment"><strong>Sunk Cost Fallacy</strong> - Instead of cutting losses, decision makers continue to pour resources into a failed endeavour.</li>
    <li class="fragment"><strong>Herding Effect</strong> - People follow the crowd without making their own informed decision.</li>
    <li class="fragment"><strong>Gambler's Fallacy</strong> - In many situations probabilities of repeated events are independent from each other. Often decision makers fail to understand this.</li>
    <li class="fragment"><strong>Default Effect</strong> - People tend to stick with pre-selected choices.</li>
    <li class="fragment"><strong>Overconfidence</strong> - People overestimate their abilities.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li class="fragment">Any other biases you know?</li>
</ul>

## Behavioral Biases

- Which biases might be responsible for the following situations?
- How can we mitigate the impact of those biases?

---

## Situation 1:

> Warren Buffett announces that he increased his exposure to Apple by buying more stocks.
> The price of AAPL goes up.

---

## Situation 2:

> A stock investor bought a big position in Disney at around 100 USD per share.
> Then, the scandal unfolds and the price plummets.
> The investor keeps buying in at 80 USD, 50 USD and finally at 5 USD, 3 USD and 1 USD.
> When a friend asks him to stop he keeps arguing to recover the losses by "buying the dip" and to "further reducing the average buying price".

---

## Situation 3:

> Peter wants to buy a new smartphone and fancies the new iPhone.
> Mentally, he is already looking forward to finally buy it, but a friend urges him to do some more research.
> He agrees and is reading through articles that pop up after googling "Why you should buy the new iPhone".

---

## Situation 4:

> A Swiss energy company could increase the number of new renewable electricity contracts from 3% to 80-90% by pre-selecting the green option when customers were renewing their energy contracts.

---

## Situation 5

> Andrew had 50 Microsoft stocks. He decided to sell 40 of them at a price of 350 USD, still keeping 10. He used his earnings to pay some bills and does not plan to buy any stocks back. In the following days he caught himself looking at the charts hoping the price would go down to less than 350 USD.

## Titan Submersible Incident

<ul>
    <li class="fragment">On board were Stockton Rush (OceanGate CEO), Paul-Henri Nargeolet (deep sea explorer), Hamish Harding and Shahzada Dawood (billionaire businessmen), and Suleman Dawood (Shahzada's son).</li>
    <li class="fragment">Communication was lost 1 hour and 45 minutes into the dive and the vessel failed to resurface later that day.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Four days later, a debris field containing parts of Titan was discovered near the Titanic.</li>

## Prior Safety Concerns

<ul>
    <li class="fragment">Many industry experts had expressed safety concerns about Titan.</li>
    <li class="fragment">OceanGate, including CEO Rush, had not sought certification for Titan.</li>
    <li class="fragment">They published the following blog post to give reasoning:</li>

## Where do you see yourself or others suffer from behavioral biases?

## Monopoly

- We have seen: Monopolists' market power leads to inefficient outcomes.
- Web 2.0 is full of firms that have a monopoly-like position in their respective domain:
  - Google
  - Uber
  - AirBnb
  - ...
- How do these firms exert their market power, if not over price-setting?

## Activities Today & Tomorrow

- You can earn points by applying the concepts presented in this course to similar situations when playing with/against your colleagues.
- In session 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3, you can increase your budget (starting at 0) during several economic games.
- We have a total budget of $3000 for this.
- The budget is split between all the games that we play and total points earned by all of you are dynamically adjusted to correspond to the budget.
- In 2.3, there is a big final: You can use your earnings to bid for amazing NFTs by a professional artist in an experimental auction setting.

## Game 2: Rules

<img rounded style="width:1200px" src="./img/2.1-cournot-1-instructions.png" />

---

## Game 2: Examples

In this game, the unit price is calculated as follows:

Unit price = 60 - sum of both goods produced

Your profit is calculated as:
Profit = Unit Price \* your amount produced

| Example | Goods Produced (Each) | Unit Price Calculation | Your Profit Calculation |
| ------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 1       | 15                    | 60 - (15 + 15) = 30    | 30 \* 15 = 450          |
| 2       | 30                    | 60 - (30 + 30) = 0     | 0 \* 30 = 0             |
| 3       | 0                     | 60 - (0 + 0) = 60      | 60 \* 0 = 0             |

## Conclusion

We learned:

- fundamental economic concepts that are important to navigate in private- and professional life.
- the notion of rationality and what to expect from actors that behave this way.
- that especially human individuals deviate from rationality and behave differently.
- the importance of time on value.
- to engage in economic situations with other human actors.
