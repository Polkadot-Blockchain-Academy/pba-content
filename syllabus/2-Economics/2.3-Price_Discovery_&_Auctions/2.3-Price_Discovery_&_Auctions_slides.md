# Lecture 3: Price Finding Mechanisms: Auctions (60 min)

### _Module 3, Lecture 3_


---

# 1. Introduction

---

* A central topic of economics is *price finding* in markets.
* It is the process by which a buyer and a seller agree on a price of a good they want to trade.
* As we have seen in Lesson 1, a market price must balance supply and demand.
    * Demand: number of items bought by consumers at a given price.
    * Supply: number of items produced at a given price.

---

<img src="/assets/img/2-Economics/2.1-supply-and-demand.png" alt="Supply and Demand" style="width:800px;"/>

---

* The concepts of supply and demand help us understand price formation from a general perspective. They describe the *outcome* of the price-finding process.
* However, they do not help much to understand *how exactly firms go about* when setting the prices for the goods they sell.
* HOW are prices set in markets?

---

* Economics has a long tradition of analyzing price setting as the decision of a single firm that wants to sell one item of some good or asset.
* The general framework assumes there are many potential buyers each with some valuation for the item.
* The main question is: how does the firm *optimally* sell its goods?
* If the firm knows the buyers' valuations then the solution is easy: Sell to the buyer with highest valuation and charge a price equal to that valuation. 

Notes:
* Throughout, we assume that the buyer purchases the good if the price is lower than, or exactly equal to, her valuation. In the second case, the buyer is *indifferent* between buying and not buying.

---


* However, in reality firms hardly know the exact valuations of their potential buyers.
* If the good is standardized and sales happen frequently, it is convenient for the firm to just post a price. (Think of any good that you buy daily in the supermarket.)
* However, for rarer goods whose sale does not happen that frequently, we often see a different machanism: auctions.
* Auctions are also often used in a blockchain context: NFTs, parachain auctions, etc.

---

* In this lecture we see in what sense auctions are superior to posting a price.
* We analyze the four most important auction formats and learn important results of auction theory:
    * Truthful bidding in a second-price auction.
    * The characterization of optimal auctions.
    * The so-called revenue-equivalence theorem.
* Last, we discuss what problems blockchain auctions face and why Polkadot employs a candle auction format.

---

# 2. Price Posting

---

* In this part we look at the problem of selling an item via price posting.
* We consider the following setup:
    * a firm with a good to sell, and
    * two potential buyers, Alice and Bob,
    * with individual valuations $v_A, v_B \in [0,1]$ for the good. 
* If these valuations are known to the firm: approach the higher-valuing buyer and charge a price $p=\max\{v_A,v_B\}$.
* If the valuations are not known to the firm, the problem is trickier.

Notes:
* $v_A,v_B \in [0,1]$ means that both valuations $v_A$ and $v_B$ are real numbers between $0$ and $1$.
* $\max\{\cdot, \cdot\}$ means: return the maximum of the two input values.
* Incomplete information is almost always the case in the real world. 
* Can you think of situations where we exactly know what value a buyer attaches to the good? (Example: )

---

To model the situation in which the firm does not know the valuations of the buyers, economists generally consider the following canonical model of incomplete information: 
* Before the sale starts, the buyers draw a valuation from $[0,1]$.
* The valuations are uniformly distributed; i.e., for each $x\in [0,1]$, $$Pr\{v_A \leq x\} = Pr\{v_B \leq x\} = x$$ 
* The valuations are independently distributed. This means that the valuation of Alice is in no way linked to the valuation of Bob.
* Each buyer knows her/his valuation but not that of the other buyer.
* The firm just knows that valuations are uniformly distributed.


Notes:
* $Pr\{v_i \leq x\}$ is the probability that the randomly drawn value of valuation $v_i$ is below $x$.
* Independent values will be important: when is this (not) a sensible assumption? (Example: oil drilling rights auctions, ...)
* Uniform distribution is just for pedagogical reasons; standard model allows for more general distributions.

---

* A firm posts a price $p \in [0,1]$ and then sells the item to whomever accepts it. 
* What is the optimal price $p$ for the firm?
* A buyer accepts it if it is lower than her valuation, $p\leq v_i$.
* Hence the firm's revenue is $$p \cdot ( 1-p^2).$$ 
* The interpretation is simple:
    * $p$ is the firm's revenue for selling the item, and
    * $(1-p^2)$ is the probability of selling it, because 
    * $p^2$ is the probability that both valuations are below $p$.
    

Notes:
* If both buyers accept the posted price, we assume the firm selects a random buyer to trade with.
* Assuming that 100% of the sale price is profit for the seller, this profit is
    * $p$ in case of selling, $0$ otherwise, where 
    * $(1-p^2)$ is the probability of selling the item.
    * To see this probability, consider conversely that the probability that none of the buyers accepts the price must be $p^2$, because each valuation must be below $p$, and these are two individual events each happening with probability $p$ (recall: valuations are uniformly distributed).


---

* This is a graph of the firm's revenue.
* Revenue is maximized at $p \approx \sqrt{1/3}$.
* At the optimum, revenue is approximately $0.38$.
* Keep this number in mind. We will see that an auction can do better.

![](https://i.imgur.com/BUY6FfZ.png)
    
* Side note: prices, valuations, and revenue are given in the same currency unit, say, USD. 

Notes:
* How do we maximize the revenue function $f(p)=p ( 1-p^2)$?
    * The function has a unique peak.
    * So, at the maximum, the first derivative must be zero.
* Hence the function is maximized for a $p$ satisfying $$ f'(p)=1-p^2 - 2p^2 = 0 \implies p = \sqrt{1/3}.$$
* Revenue is then $f(\sqrt{1/3})=\frac{2}{3}\sqrt{1/3}\approx 0.38.$ 


---

# 3. Auctions

![](https://i.imgur.com/yLLa8UL.gif)

---

* Intuition: auctions yield a higher revenue than price posting because they create competition among buyers.
* The firm (auctioneer) asks the buyers (bidders) to submit bids, then allocates the item to one of them accordingly. The winner's payment is also a function of the bids.
* An auction is a competitive game for buyers, where the seller makes the rules.


---

* Before we go into the analysis of auctions, we give an overview.
* There are two broad classes:
    * *Static Auction:* all bidders submit their bids at the same time. 
    * *Dynamic Auction:* bidders submit bids over time.
* The crucial difference is that in static auctions bidders do not react to the bids of others while in dynamic auctions they do.
* For this reason, static auctions are sometimes known as *sealed-bid auctions*, referring to a style where bids are submitted in sealed envelopes.

---


There are four auction formats you should know as a blockchain developer:
* Static auctions
    * with a first-price payment rule.
    * with a second-price payment rule.
* Dynamic Auctions
    * English auction (a.k.a. ascending price).
    * Dutch auction (a.k.a. descending price).
* You will also learn how the auction format used by Polkadot, the candle auction, fits in here.

---

* **Static first-price auction:**  each bidder gives offer that cannot be changed later, i.e., the bid is metaphorically ‘sealed’. The highest bidder wins and pays her bid.
* Example: Four potential buyers are bidding on a racehorse. Each makes a secret bid and submits it to the auctioneer. 
* The seller opens the bids: $30,000 by $A$, $42,000 by $B$, $38,000 by $C$, and $49,000 by $D$. 
* The seller declares $D$ as winner and the price paid is $49,000.

---

* **Static second-price auctions:** Again bids cannot be changed, and highest bidder wins. But this time the winner only pays the second-highest bid.
* Same example: if the bids are $30,000 by $A$, $42,000 by $B$, $38,000 by $C$ and  $49,000 by $D$, then the winner is $D$ but the price paid is only $42,000.

---

Why second-price payment rule? We will see that:
* With this rule everyone bids truthfully, i.e., bids correspond to actual valuations.
* This is strategically simpler for bidders than in a first-price rule.
* At the same time, both payment rules raise the same expected revenue.


---

* **English (ascending-price) auction:** 
    * the auctioneer continually raises the price,
    * bidders that accept the price stay in the race,
    * those that do not accept it leave, and
    * the auction runs until a last bidder remains active.
* This auction is very common in ... England.
* Observe: It has a flavour of a second-price auction: the price you pay is decided by the second-to-last bidder to leave. In a sense the two auctions are *strategically equivalent.*

---

* **Dutch (descending-price) auction:**, 
    * the auctioneer continually lowers the price,
    * until the first bidder accepts,
    * this bidder wins and pays the price she accepted.
* This auction is very common in ... the Netherlands (esp. tulip auctions).
* Observe: It has a flavor of a first-price auction: you pick the price you pay. In a sense the two are *strategically equivalent.*

---

# 4. Second-Price Auction

---

* We start our analysis here as this auction is strategically the simplest one.
* It is strategically simple because bidding your true valuation is optimal!
* To show this, consider the two-bidder case from before: 
    * Alice and Bob know their own valuations $v_A$ and $v_B$.
    * The valuations are uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$.
    * Each bidder may submit any bid $b_A, b_B \geq 0$.
    * The highest bidder wins, paying the second-highest bid.

---

## 4.1 Truthful Equilibrium

---

**Fact:** For each bidder, it is optimal to bid their actual valuation ($b_A=v_A$ and $b_B=v_B$) *no matter what the other bidder bids*.

**Proof:** Consider Alice (same proof for Bob).

* Suppose $b_A < v_A$, i.e., she bids under her valuation:
    * If Bob bids $b_B< b_A$, then Alice wins and pays $b_B$, and raising her bid would not have changed anything.
    * If Bob bids $b_B > v_A$, then Alice loses, and raising her bid to $v_A$ would not have changed anything.
    * However, if $b_B\in [b_A, v_A]$, bidding $v_A$ would have been better for Alice, as she would have won (and paid $b_B\leq v_A$).
    * Consequently, bidding $b_A < v_A$ is (weakly) dominated by bidding $v_A$.

---

**Proof: (cont'd)**

* Suppose $b_A> v_A$, i.e., she bids over her valuation:
    * If Bob bids $b_B< v_A$, then Alice wins and pays $b_B$, and lowering her bid to $v_A$ would not have changed anything.
    * If Bob bids $b_B> b_A$, then Alice loses, and lowering her bid would not have changed anything.
    * However, if $b_B \in [v_A,b_A]$, Alice "wins" and pays $b_B\geq v_A$ (with a net loss) so lowering her bid to $v_A$ would have been better for Alice.
    * Consequently, bidding $b_A > v_A$ is (weakly) dominated by bidding $v_A$.
* Together, we have the claim.

Notes:
* A player's action $\alpha$ is *weakly dominated* by another action $\beta$ if $\beta$ produces an outcome that is at least as good as the outcome produced by $\alpha$, no matter what the other player does.
* A player's action $\alpha$ is *strictly dominated* by another action $\beta$ if $\beta$ produces an outcome that is strictly better than the outcome produced by $\alpha$, no matter what the other player does.
* The proof can be easily generalized to any number of bidders, to obtain that in a second-price auction, any bidder's strategy is weakly dominated by the strategy of bidding their own valuation.

---

## 4.2 Expected Revenue and Optimal Auctions

---

* The auctioneer's expected revenue in the second-price auction is the expected value of the second highest valuation. 
* For two independent variables uniformly sampled between $0$ and $1$, the expected value of the minimum of these variables is $1/3\approx 0.33$ 
(further details in lecture notes).


Notes:
* Let $F(x)$ be the cumulative density function (CDF) of the lowest of Alice and Bob's valuations, $\min\{v_A, v_B\}$, where $v_A$ and $v_B$ are independent variables sampled uniformly from $[0,1]$.
* By definition, for any $x$ in $[0,1]$, $F(x)$ is the probability that the lower valuation is below $x$, or equivalently, $g(x):=1-F(x)$ is the probability that both valuations are above $x$; clearly $g(x)=(1-x)^2$, and hence $F(x)=1-(1-x)^2$.
* From the CDF, we can compute the probability density function (PDF) by derivation: $f(x)=\frac{d}{dx}F(x)=2(1-x)$.
* Finally, the expected value is computed from the PDF with the integral formula
$$\int_0^1 x\cdot f(x) dx = 2\int_0^1 (x-x^2)dx=2\cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{3}\right)=\frac{1}{3}.$$

---

* This is not quite as good as posting a price (which provided revenue $0.38$). Why not? 
* Because the auction we considered was not optimal for the auctioneer!
* The optimal auction involves a *reserve price* $r>0$: 
    * If no bid is above $r$, nobody wins. 
    * If one bid is above $r$, the payment is $r$.
    * If both bids are above $r$, the payment is the second-highest bid.

---

* Under a reserve price $r$, it is still optimal for all bidders to be truthful, hence the expected revenue is  
\begin{align}
R(r)&= 0\cdot Pr[v_A, v_B<r] + r\cdot Pr\Big[\min\{v_A, v_B \} \leq r \leq \max\{v_A, v_B \}\Big] \\
&+ E\Big[\min\{v_A, v_B\} \ | \ r\leq \min\{v_A, v_B\} \Big] \cdot Pr\Big[r\leq \min\{v_A, v_B\} \Big] \\
&= \frac{1}{3} + r^2 - \frac{4}{3}r^3.
\end{align}
(details in lecture notes)

Notes: 
* Clearly, the prob. that both valuations are below $r$ is $r^2$, the prob. that both valuations are above $r$ is $(1-r)^2$, and the prob. that $r$ is in between the valuations is $2r(1-r)$. You can check that these probabilities sum up to one.
* Hence, out of the three terms above for the expected revenue, the first term is zero and the second term is $2r^2(1-r)$.
* To compute the third term, we simply copy the integral formula for the expected value (from two slides ago), but we restrict the integration limits to $[r, 1]$:
\begin{align}
\int_r^1 x\cdot f(x) dx &= 2\int_r^1 (x-x^2)dx\\
&=2\cdot \left[\frac{x^2}{2}-\frac{x^3} {3}\right]_r^1 \\&=\frac{1}{3} - r^2 + \frac{2}{3}r^3.
\end{align}
* Putting all terms together, we obtain that the expected revenue is 
$$R(r)=0+2r^2(1-r)+\left(\frac{1}{3} - r^2 + \frac{2}{3}r^3\right)=\frac{1}{3}+r^2-\frac{4}{3}r^3.$$

Plot of the auctioneer's expected revenue, $R(r)=1/3 + r^2 - 4r^3/3$, as a function of $r$.

Notes:
* In the plot, we see that revenue is increasing at $r=0$. So, a positive reserve price is optimal.
* It turns out that the expected revenue is maximized for $r=0.5$.

---

* The expected revenue is maximal for $r=1/2$, at which point it is $5/12\approx 0.42$. 
* **Optimal Auctions (Myerson, 1981):** If the aim is to maximize revenue in an auction, then the auction will often have a reserve price!
* Literature: Myerson, Roger B. "Optimal auction design." Mathematics of Operations Research 6, No. 1 (1981): 58-73.

Notes:
* If the auctioneer chooses a reveal price of $r=1/2$, their expected revenue is around $0.42$, so this auction is better than the posted price.
* To maximize the auctioneer's expected revenue function $R(r)$ above: 
    - We evaluate the function at all the local extrema (minima and maxima). 
    - Since the function is continuous and differentiable, the local extrema are found at the borders $r=0$ and $r=1$, and at the roots of the derivative $R'(r)=2r-4r^2=0$. These roots are $r=0$ and $r=1/2$. 
    - By inspecting all these points, we find that the global maximum is found at $r=1/2$, with a value of $R(1/2)=5/12$.

# 5. English Auction

* Recall the rules:
    * The auctioneer continually raises the price.
    * At any price, you decide whether to stay or leave.
    * If you leave, you may not return.
    * If you are the last one in the auction you win and pay the price at which the second-to-last bidder left.

---

## 5.1 Strategic Equivalence to SPA

---

* The English auction is *strategically equivalent* to the static second-price auction.
* Specifically, it is a (weakly) dominant strategy to stay in the auction until the price reaches one's valuation.
* Doing so, the expected payment is the also the same: the expected second highest valuation.
* Consequently, the English auction is also *revenue equivalent* to the second-price auction for the auctioneer.

Notes:
* Why is staying until the price reaches your valuation weakly dominant?
* If you leave you get zero utility.
* If you stay and the price is below your valuation, then your utility is above zero (or equal to zero).
* If you stay and the price is above your valuation, your utility is negative.

---

## 5.2 The Problem of Shill-Bidding

---

* While second-price and English auctions are very popular among theorists, they are not so popular among practitioners.
* One reason is that it is prone to *shill-bidding*.
* Shill-bidder: Bidder that acts on behalf of the auctioneer to drive up the price (at no cost if he doesn't win).
* This also a primary reason why Polkadot employs an auction format in which you pay what you bid.

---

# 6. First-Price Auction and Dutch Auction

--- 

## 6.1 The static first-price auction

---

* In the static first-price auction, the winning bidder pays her bid.
* The rest of the rules are the same as in the second-price auction; i.e., 
    * all bidders submit their bids simultaneously,
    * the highest bid wins.

---

**Fact:** In a first-price auction with two players, where the valuations are independent uniform values on $[0,1]$, it is a *Nash equilibrium* for both bidders to bid half of their valuations, i.e., $b_A = v_A/2$ and $b_B=v_B/2$.

Notes:
- A Nash equilibrium, named after mathematician John Nash, is a central concept in game theory. A set of strategies (one for each player) is a Nash equilibrium if no-one has an incentive to change their strategy.
- In other words, a Nash equilibrium is a "recommended strategy per player", such that if you assume that the other player will follow it, then the best you can do is also follow it. As the same is true for the other player, it is indeed a reasonable assumption to think the other player will follow this strategy.
- However, if the other player picks an unexpected strategy, your recommended strategy may be suboptimal. In this sense, a Nash equilibrium is a weaker concept than a (weakly or strongly) dominant strategy, in which the strategies of other players is irrelevant.

---

**Proof:**
* Consider Alice, and assume Bob bids $b_B=v_B/2$ (same analysis for Bob).
* Alice's expected utility when submitting a bid $b$ is 
\begin{align}
(v_A-b)\cdot Pr[b_B \leq b] &= (v_A-b)\cdot Pr[v_B/2 \leq b] \\
&= (v_A-b)\cdot Pr[v_B \leq 2b] \\
&= (v_A-b)\cdot 2b.
\end{align}
* This value is maximized when $b=v_A/2$, for which Alice obtains an expected utility of $v_A^2/2$.
* In summary, if Bob plays $b_B=v_B/2$, then it is optimal for Alice to play $b_A=v_A/2$, and vice-versa.
* Together we have a Nash equilibrium.

---

* Bidding in the first-price auction is **not** truthful.
* Bidders *shade* their bid; i.e., they bid below their value.
* It is clear that bidding truthfully can never be optimal: if you win, you earn nothing.
* So, bidding below your value is strictly better because you win sometimes and when you do you have a strictly positive utility.

---

* What is the expected revenue of the first-price auction?
* By the last result, it is reasonable to assume each bidder will bid half their valuation.
* Hence, the revenue is $\frac{1}{2}\max\{v_A, v_B\}$. 
* The expected value of $\max\{v_A, v_B\}$ is $2/3$ (details in notes).
* Hence, the expected revenue is $1/3$.
* This is the same as in the second-price auction!

Notes:
* Recall that the valuations $v_A$ and $v_B$ are assumed to be independent variables uniformly drawn from $[0,1]$.
* The cumulative density function (CDF) of the higher valuation, $\max\{v_A, v_B\}$, is $F(x)=x^2$. This is because $F(x)$ is lower than $x$ only if both valuations are below $x$, and these are two independent events each happening with probability $x$.
* Then, the probability density function (PDF) is $f(x)=F'(x)=2x$.
* And the formula for the expected value of $\max\{v_A, v_B\}$ is 
$$R = \int\limits_0^1 x\cdot f(x)\mathrm d x = \int\limits_0^1 2x^2 \mathrm d v = \frac{2}{3}.$$


---

* **Revenue Equivalence Theorem (Myersion, 1981):** When valuations are independent and private as in our model, then *all auction mechanisms* that allocate the good to the highest-valuing bidder in equilibrium are *revenue equivalent*. 
* First-price vs. second-price auction: In the first-price auction, bidders bid below their valuation. At the same time, they have to pay their bid when winning. Together, this gives the same expected payment as the second-price auction.

---

## 6.2 Dutch Auction

---

* Recall the rules:
    * The auctioneer continually lowers the price.
    * At any price, you can decide whether or not to accept the price.
    * If you are the first to accept the price, you win  and pay the price you just accepted.


---

* It turns out that the Dutch auction is strategically equivalent and revenue equivalent to the static first-price auction.
* The price that you accept in the Dutch auction corresponds to the price that you'd bid in a static first-price auction.
* The tradeoffs that the bidders face are very similar: take the current price or wait a bit at the risk of another bidder accepting first. It is an equilibrium to wait till the price is half your valuation.

---

## 6.3 Front-Running

---

* An annoying problem for auctions on the blockchain is *front-running*.
* Front-running: Seeing and reacting to other bidders' bids before they are written onto the chain.
* Static first-price auction: Don't bid $b_i=v_i/2$ but just slightly outbid highest bid in the mempool. 
* However, a bidder without the technical capacity to front-run has a reduced probability of winning, hence less incentive to bid at all.
* Problem: potentially inefficient outcome; i.e., not the highest valuing bidder wins.

---

# 7. Recap

---

* We analyzed the four most important auction formats,
    1. Static first-price auction.
    2. Static second-price auction.
    3. English auction.
    4. Dutch auction.
* We learned that in the standard environment:
    1. All auctions are revenue-equivalent.
    2. The optimal auction has a reserve price.
    3. The optimal auction is better than posting a price.

# Workshop: The Candle Auction on Polkadot  (90 mins)

---

## Candle Auction: Theory

---

* Blockchain auctions face two major problems:
    * Valuations of smart contracts are known.
    * Front running: Upcoming bids are known.
* The first means: no second-price auctions (neither static nor English), because of potential shill bidding.
* The second means: no static first-price auction.

---

* Polkadot's solution: candle auction.
* Candle auction: dynamic first-price auction with random ending time.
    * As long as the auction is open: any bidder can submit a bid.
    * All bids are observed by all bidders.
    * Bids must be increasing.
* Ending time: the moment the auction stops and the winning bid is determined (the highest bid at the time the auction ends).
* Dynamic Auction with a fixed ending time: Ebay.

![](https://i.imgur.com/23Y8Cyv.jpg)

---
* Aside: In Polkadot, the candle auction rule is not used to sell a single good, but a package of goods (lease periods).
* That is, it is an instance of a *Package auction*.
* Package auction: sale of multiple goods, where you can not only place a bid on the individual goods but on any package of it. 

---

* W3F research shows: candle auction mitigates front-running problems (in the single good case).
* Another side-effect of candle: no sniping. 
* Sniping:
    * Waiting until right before the auction ends to place a bid.
    * The practice is generally associated with low revenue.
* We will now play a candle auction.

## Candle Auction: Experiment

---

- Big Final: Students have the chance to use the budget they accumulated during the last lessons to bid for special NFTs in a one-shot candle auction.
- We didive students into groups of 3-4 to bid.
- The Candle Auction can last longer (say 30 seconds preparation phase + 5 min bidding phase).
- Auction off several NFTs in a oTree Candle Auction.
- This is an experiment that W3F research (Florian, Jonas, Samuel) has implemented to be played in a lab.
- The students will get the necessary instructions on their screens.
- **Results**: As this is the last lesson, we will also immediately present the results of the auction, show average prices per markets, when the candle went out, etc.
