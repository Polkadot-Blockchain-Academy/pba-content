## Lesson 5: Game Theory Exploits & Prediction Markets (60min)

### UNIMPLEMENTED - TBD if slides should be created

<!-- TODO CONTENT ^^^ -->

_Note: Perhaps we reframe this section to be about 'exploits in game theory' or 'Price discovery/prediction markets'. We should not teach Defi in this module at all. Automated Market Makers could be used in this module._

### Why it is important

A key concept of traditional auctions, order books, are hard to implement on blockchains, which is why people have come up with, e.g., automated market makers. Decentralized finance is undoubtedly one of the most powerful and important areas of decentralized applications. As mentioned, it is imperative to build incentives correctly, otherwise users will find a way to exploit the system in any way possible to make money.

### Prerequisites

- Topics are heavily dependent on previous lesson 4a.

### Learning outcome

We introduce DeFi and some related topics in algorithmic game theory and mechanism design.

### Learning outcomes

Students...

- will have an overview on alternative price discovery methods.
- will understand the main types of DeFi apps that can be implemented, and good rules of thumb on how to develop them.

### Content

- Intro to decentralized finance. What and why? Advantages and technical limitations.
- Prediction markets (e.g. Iowa Electronic Market) and other belief aggregators, proper scores (e.g. logarithmic market scoring rule).
- Decentralized exchanges: automated market makers vs order books, liquidity providers, arbitrage, their use as price oracles.
- Experiments in DeFi: flash loans, HydraDX price finding mechanism, Squeeth leverage.
