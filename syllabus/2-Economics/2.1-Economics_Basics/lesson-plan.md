# Economics Basics

This session lays the groundwork for understanding basic economic principles. These principles provide the framework within which decisions are made and analyzed in the field of economics and beyond.

### Why is this important

Understanding fundamental concepts in economics is crucial not only for the upcoming sessions but also for the student's future work as incentive architects. Economics, at its core, is the study of how people make decisions in the face of scarcity and how these decisions impact the world around them. As incentive architects, understanding these dynamics allows students to design systems and mechanisms that guide decision-making towards desirable outcomes.

### Prerequisites

None. This session is designed as an introduction to economics and assumes no prior knowledge.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this session, participants should be able to utilize core economic concepts as taught in this session in subsequent sessions. They'll be equipped with a basic understanding of economic theory and how it applies to real-world scenarios.

### Learning Objectives
