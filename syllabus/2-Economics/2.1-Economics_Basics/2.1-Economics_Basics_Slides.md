Notes:

- Note that cryptographic primitives offer guarantees while economic principles offer vague predictions.
- They often fail for individuals but mostly hold for the collective.
- Crypto & Econ pair well! Together they are the toolbox to design unstoppable systems.
- They have a great symphony: where cryptography's has boundaries, economics offers solutions and vice versa.

## Guiding Human Behavior

> An incentive is a bullet, a key:<br/>an often tiny object with astonishing power to change a situation.<br/>-- Steven Levitt --

Notes:

- Human behavior is driven by incentives.
- The aggregation of these behaviors lead to societies.
- Carefully designing incentives lays the ground for functioning systems.
- You might be asked to implement certain protocols, which you have to judge if they make sense / can be improved.

---

## Understanding Incentives

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Motivate individuals or groups to perform certain actions.</li>
<li class="fragment">Historically, incentives were designed to influence human behavior both on a macroeconomic and microeconomic level.</li>
<li class="fragment">Most commonly, people refer to money, that fall under the umbrella of extrinsic incentives.</li>
<li class="fragment">But not all incentives are monetary!</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## Different Types of Economic Incentives

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">In a workplace setting (microeconomic level), employees are often motivated by various forms of economic incentives:
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Flat Rate: A fixed amount of salary irrespective of performance.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Piece Rate: Pay based on the quantity of output produced.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Bonus: Additional rewards for excellent performance.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Relative Incentives: Rewards relative to the performance of others (competitive incentives).</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

Notes:

- **Question: What are the advantages / disadvantages of those incentives?**

---

## Rationality in Economics

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Economic theories often assume rationality, implying that actors:
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Are primarily driven by monetary gains (payoff maximization).</li>
    <li class="fragment">Act in self-interest.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Have unlimited cognitive resources.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li class="fragment">Remark: In this, all factors can be translated into monetary terms.</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## Incentives often work well

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Interest rates set by central banks can stimulate or cool down economic activity.</li>
<li class="fragment">Lower interest rates encourage borrowing and investing, leading to economic expansion.</li>
<li class="fragment">Conversely, higher interest rates can slow down inflation and stabilize the economy.</li>
<li class="fragment">These interest rate adjustments, a form of economic incentive, play a significant role in maintaining economic balance.</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## Incentives can Backfire

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">In India during British rule, the British Government was concerned about the large number of venomous Cobras.
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">They offered a bounty for every dead cobra.</li>
    <li class="fragment">People started to breed cobras at home to sell them.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Once the government stopped the programm, breeders released the cobras causing larger numbers than before.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---


## Goodhart's Law

> When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure

---

## Perverse Incentives

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">In Haifa (Israel) parents often got their kids late from day care, which caused childcare workers frustration.</li>
<li class="fragment">The idea was to fine parents for getting their kids late.</li>
<li class="fragment">The program was rolled out in some daycares and not others.</li>
<li class="fragment">Traditional economic theory would predict parents to want to avoid the fine.
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">The opposite happened: In daycares with the fine, many more parents were late.</li>
    <li class="fragment">After the fine was abolished, parents still were more late.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li class="fragment">--> Extrinsic motivation can crowd out intrinsic motivation.</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

Notes:

- **Question: Why did that happen?**
- Gneezy & Rustichini (2000)

---

## The Power of Intrinsic Incentives

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Beyond monetary gain, people are also motivated by intrinsic factors.</li>
<li class="fragment">These can include social preferences, personal morals, and deeply-held beliefs.</li>
<li class="fragment">Economic models often fail to account for these motivations, leading to unexpected outcomes in real-world applications.</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## From Human Actors to Automated Agents

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">While intrinsic incentives are essential in human interactions, the digital age has introduced new actors in our economic systems.</li>
<li class="fragment">Automated agents, like algorithms or digital bots, respond to incentives, often financial ones, in their coded environments.</li>
<li class="fragment">This shifts the application of incentives beyond a human context and into the realm of digital systems and automated processes.</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## Conclusion: The Dynamic Nature of Incentives

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Incentives continue to be fundamental to interactions in society, whether among humans or between automated systems.</li>
<li class="fragment">As we understand more about incentives in different contexts, we can better design them to influence behavior effectively.</li>
<li class="fragment">Intrinsic motivations remain key, but in certain contexts, like automated systems, monetary incentives also play a significant role.</li>
<li class="fragment">The challenge is to balance these factors to achieve the desired outcomes.</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

## Demand & Supply: The Pillars of Market Equilibrium

A common model to help predict and rationalize the price<br/>which emerges from a market.

Can be used to (gu)estimate the quantity<br/>of produced goods vs. their market prices.

Notes:

Examples:

- A famous artist dies and her art increases in price.
- An unusually nice summer reduces hotel prices in popular vacations to escape the heat.

---

## Law of Demand: A Basic Principle

- When prices increase, quantity demanded of a good (generally) decreases.

Notes:

- **Question: Anybody know expections?**
- Exception are "Veblen goods" where demand increases when price increases.
  These are typically luxury goods that signal something (e.g. status, reputation) in addition to being useful to consumption.
  Examples are jewelry, luxury cars, etc.
  - The demand for a Veblen good may increase when the price increases.
    This is not a contradiction to the law of demand because the good's social value depends on the price; i.e., the good "changes" and becomes more desirable as the price increases.

---

## Visualizing Demand: The Demand Curve

<img src="../../../assets/img/2-Economics/2.1-market-demand.png" alt="Market Demand" style="width:900px;" />

Notes:

- **Question: What influences the aggregate market demand?**
- The market demand is the sum of all individual curves.

---

## Influences on demand?

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Price (Demand moves along the curve)</li>
<li class="fragment">Size of consumer base</li>
<li class="fragment">Average disposable income of consumer base</li>
<li class="fragment">Price of substitution goods</li>
<li class="fragment">Preferences prevalent within consumer base</li>
<li class="fragment">Expectations prevalent within consumer base</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

Notes:

- In the ice cream example, a substitution good could be frozen yoghurt: if its price goes down, the demand for ice cream will decrease.
- If people's appetite for ice cream increases (perhaps via advertisement), the demand will increase.
- In people expect a shortage of ice cream in the near future, the demand will increase immediately.

---


## Moving the demand curve

<img src="../../../assets/img/2-Economics/2.1-demand-curve.png" alt="Market Demand Shift" style="width:1100px;" />

---

## Law of Supply: The Other Side of the Coin

- If the price of a good increases, the quantity supplied also increases

(because suppliers can make more profit!).

Notes:

- That is, assuming that suppliers manage to sell all produced goods at said price.
- For example, if the ice cream price increases the store will hire a second employee to sell more scoops per hour.
- As another example, some petroleum deposits are easier and cheaper to extract than others, so some deposits will be extracted only if the oil price is above a certain threshold.

---

## Demand and Supply Interplay: Market Equilibrium

<img style="width: 800px;" src="../../../assets/img/2-Economics/2.1-supply-and-demand.png" />

- What happens when Price is higher than the Eq. Price?
- What if the Quantity is lower than the Eq. Quantity?
- Moving either supply or demand leads to new Eq.

Notes:

- Where the curves meet we obtain a point of equilibrium, which establishes a market quantity and a market price.
- If price is higher than equilibrium price, there is more supply than demand, so some goods remain unsold, and sellers will be forced to reduce the price to get rid of their stock.
  Similarly if the price is lower than equilibrium price, there is more demand than supply, which leads to shortages of the good; sellers will notice this and increase the price.
  Hence, we always converge to the equilibrium price.
- Similarly, if the quantity supplied is too low, there is a business opportunity to supply more unit of the good and make a profit, so eventually someone will increase the supply quantity.

---

## Elasticity

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">It measures of how much buyers and sellers respond to changes in market conditions.</li>
<li class="fragment">It allows to quantify the concept of sensitivity in the demand and supply model, giving a deeper understanding of market dynamics.</li>
<li class="fragment">Specifically, price elasticity of demand and supply quantifies the response of quantity demanded or supplied to a change in price.</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## Understanding Elasticity

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">High elasticity: small price changes can have a large impact on quantity demanded or supplied.</li>
<li class="fragment">Low elasticity: demand or supply is said to be inelastic, and quantity does not respond strongly to price changes.</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

Notes:

- High Elasticity: luxury goods, where buyers can easily adjust their consumption.
- Low Elasticity: essential goods such as energy / medicine.

---

## Conclusion: The Dynamics of Demand and Supply

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Demand/supply model forces in markets and can be used to estimate equilibrium quantity/price.</li>
<li class="fragment">All other things being equal:
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">demand decreases with increasing price</li>
    <li class="fragment">supply increases with increasing price</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li class="fragment">There are different factors influencing supply & demand curves.
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Elasticity</li>
    <li class="fragment">Some shift the equilibrium on the curve</li>
    <li class="fragment">Others move the entire curves.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

## Market forms

### (Or: why monopoly bad?)

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Typically, economists distinguish between three market forms.
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Perfect competition: Many firms, many consumers.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Oligopoly: Few firms, many consumers.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Monopoly: One firm, many consumers.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li class="fragment">The more competition a firm faces, the less market power it has.</li>
<li class="fragment">Market power: ability to affect the price (through choosing a certain production level).</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

Notes:

- Special form of Oligopoly is the Duopoly with two firms, something that we see later.

---

## Market Form Examples

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Monopoly:
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Postal services in many European countries.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Railway services in many European countries.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li class="fragment">Oligopoly:
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Cloud provider (AWS, Google, ...)</li>
    <li class="fragment">Mobile phone service.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li class="fragment">Perfect Competition:
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Consumer products with low barrier to entry (e.g., kebab stand in Berlin ü•ôüôà, espresso bar in Italy ‚òïÔ∏èüôà)</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## Why discuss this?

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Current web2 landscape consists of several firms with a lot of market power in their respective market segment.</li>
<li class="fragment">We want to understand, from an economic perspective, why too much market power is not a good thing.</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## Perfect Competition

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Under perfect competition ...
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">there are so many firms that a single firm's production quantity does not affect market price.</li>
    <li class="fragment">the marginal costs (cost of one additional unit) of production equals the market price.</li>
    <li class="fragment">firms have 0 profit.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

Notes:

- This makes sense: The firm produces up to the point where an additional unit costs exactly what it gets for it on the market.
- Notice that having the market price be equal to the marginal production costs is pretty surprising, as it is ideal from a point of view of society welfare, even though every firm is acting selfishly.
- In this perfect world, firms will have zero economic profit, meaning they make just enough money to cover production costs and keep the company running.

---

---

## Monopoly

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Monopolist: single seller of the good or service, serves the entire market.</li>
<li class="fragment">Market characterized by a high barrier of entry (e.g. big investment, legal restrictions).</li>
<li class="fragment">Monopolist is therefore sole price-setter and serves only to maximize their own profits.</li>
<li class="fragment">This leads to sub-optimal pricing and sub-optimal society welfare: consumers either pay more than they should ("monopolist tax") or are excluded from market.</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## Oligopolies

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Oligopolies are somewhere between monopolies and perfect competition.</li>
<li class="fragment">Because of the competition between firms
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">prices are lower, and</li>
    <li class="fragment">overall market participation is higher.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## What did we learn?

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Markets differ in how much market power the firms possess.</li>
<li class="fragment">Economics typically distinguishes between three forms (ordered by increasing market power):
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Perfect competition: many firms in the market.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Oligopoly: few firms in the market.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Monopoly: one firm in the market.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li class="fragment">The problem of monopoly is the result of an inefficiently high price.</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

## Economics of Specialization

#### _(or: why bother trading at all?)_

> It is the maxim of every prudent master of a family, never to attempt to make at home what it will cost him more to make than to buy.<br/>-- Adam Smith, 1776 --

Notes:

- In this part, we take a closer look at the following concepts:
  - Comparative advantage.
  - Opportunity costs.
  - Gains from trade.

---

## The economic question

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Empirical puzzle: many countries trade even though one has an advantage in producing many of the traded goods.</li>
<li class="fragment">E.g., the US is well-equipped to cheaply produce both
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">complex computer chips, and</li>
    <li class="fragment">agricultural goods (e.g., potatoes).</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li class="fragment">However, the US specializes in producing the former and importing many agricultural goods.</li>
<li class="fragment">Question: Why do countries specialize; why do they trade?</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## Opportunity costs

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Whenever you do something you refrain from doing something else that is possibly profitable.</li>
<li class="fragment">The foregone profit is you opportunity cost.</li>
<li class="fragment">E.g., you could either watch a football match or do some consulting work to earn 200$ per hour.</li>
<li class="fragment">So, your opportunity cost of watching the match is 400 dollars!</li>
<li class="fragment"><em>Opportunity costs are everywhere!</em></li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## Comparative advantage

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Back to our trade example:
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Suppose the US can produce ten times more chips than potatoes per hour.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Suppose there is another country (a potential <em>exporter</em>) that can produce ten times more potatoes than chips per hour.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li class="fragment">The US has a <em>comparative</em> advantage over the exporter at producing chips.
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">The US has lower <em>opportunity</em> costs of producing chips (in terms of foregone potatoes).</li>
    <li class="fragment">That is, to produce one chip the US gives up much less produced potatoes than the exporter would.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li class="fragment">By the same observation, the exporter has a comparative advantage at producing potatoes.</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## Comparative advantage II

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">If both the US and the exporters focus on their comparative advantage, then total welfare is higher than in a situation of autarky!</li>
<li class="fragment">Why?
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Suppose both the US and the exporter require both chips and potatoes.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Situation A: both the US and the exporter divide their time equally between producing chips and producing potatoes.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Situation B: the US only produces chips and the exporter only produces potatoes.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Total production of chips and potatoes is higher in Situation B!</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Specialization result</strong>: If, in Situation B, the countries can trade with each other they are both better off than in Situation A.</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

## Time: The Ultimate Resource

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Time is the one resource that is uniformly distributed and yet cannot be accumulated or saved for later.</li>
<li class="fragment">It's always moving, never at rest. This unique property of time lends it incredible implications.</li>
<li class="fragment">In the context of money and finance, time holds immense power, embodied in the concept of the Time Value of Money.</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## The Intriguing Relationship of Time and Money

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">The value of money is deeply connected to time. Money now is worth more than the same amount in the future.</li>
<li class="fragment">It stems from the concept of opportunity. The money at hand now could be invested, potentially earning more money.</li>
<li class="fragment">This potential earning capacity bestows more value to present money over future money.</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## Present Value: The Value of Now

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Present Value brings some future value back to the present moment.</li>
<li class="fragment">It reflects the worth of a future promise in today's terms, based on the potential earnings we could achieve now.</li>
<li class="fragment">It is the manifestation of time's relentless march.</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## Time Value of Money: A Guiding Principle

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">The Time Value of Money concept intertwines the immutable flow of time and the potential of money.</li>
<li class="fragment">It underlines the importance of wise decisions today for a brighter tomorrow.</li>
<li class="fragment">It shows that nothing is for free. You always give up something.</li>
<li class="fragment">It's a fundamental cornerstone guiding personal savings, investments, and wide-ranging financial decisions.</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## Behavioral Biases

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">For a long time economic theory was built on the assumption that all actors are <em>rational</em>.
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">No regard for fairness, altruism, equality.</li>
    <li class="fragment">All available information is considered.</li>
    <li class="fragment">No influence of emotions.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li class="fragment">This works well in many circumstances (e.g., on an aggregate level or assuming highly rational actors like firms executives) but in many it doesn't.</li>
<li class="fragment">Most humans are prone to Behavioral Biases and are influenced by social preferences.</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

---

## Behavioral Economics

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Behavioral economics is mainly concerned with the bounds of rationality of economic agents.</li>
<li class="fragment">Influenced by psychological aspects such as emotions, cognition as well as cultural and societal factors.</li>
<li class="fragment">Psychologist Daniel Kahnemann received the 2002 Nobel Prize for <em>Prospect Theory</em>, a fundamental theory in Behavioral Economics.</li>
<li class="fragment">PT models the fact that individuals assess their losses differently than their gains.</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">The value of money is deeply connected to time. Money now is worth more than the same amount in the future.</li>
<li class="fragment">It stems from the concept of opportunity. The money at hand now could be invested, potentially earning more money.</li>
<li class="fragment">This potential earning capacity bestows more value to present money over future money.</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

## Present Value: The Value of Now

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Present Value brings some future value back to the present moment.</li>
<li class="fragment">It reflects the worth of a future promise in today's terms, based on the potential earnings we could achieve now.</li>
<li class="fragment">It is the manifestation of time's relentless march.</li>
</ul>

## Time Value of Money: A Guiding Principle

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">The Time Value of Money concept intertwines the immutable flow of time and the potential of money.</li>
<li class="fragment">It underlines the importance of wise decisions today for a brighter tomorrow.</li>
<li class="fragment">It shows that nothing is for free. You always give up something.</li>
<li class="fragment">It's a fundamental cornerstone guiding personal savings, investments, and wide-ranging financial decisions.</li>
</ul>

## Behavioral Biases

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">For a long time economic theory was built on the assumption that all actors are <em>rational</em>.
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">No regard for fairness, altruism, equality.</li>
    <li class="fragment">All available information is considered.</li>
    <li class="fragment">No influence of emotions.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li class="fragment">This works well in many circumstances (e.g., on an aggregate level or assuming highly rational actors like firms executives) but in many it doesn't.</li>
<li class="fragment">Most humans are prone to Behavioral Biases and are influenced by social preferences.</li>
</ul>

## Behavioral Economics

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Behavioral economics is mainly concerned with the bounds of rationality of economic agents.</li>
<li class="fragment">Influenced by psychological aspects such as emotions, cognition as well as cultural and societal factors.</li>
<li class="fragment">Psychologist Daniel Kahnemann received the 2002 Nobel Prize for <em>Prospect Theory</em>, a fundamental theory in Behavioral Economics.</li>
<li class="fragment">PT models the fact that individuals assess their losses differently than their gains.</li>
</ul>

## Behavioral Economics

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment"><strong><em>Behavior is not random!</em></strong></li>
<li class="fragment">Key behavioral biases include:
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment"><strong>Confirmation Bias</strong> - Decision makers focus on information that cater to their prior belief / opinion and neglect other information.</li>
    <li class="fragment"><strong>Sunk Cost Fallacy</strong> - Instead of cutting losses, decision makers continue to pour resources into a failed endeavour.</li>
    <li class="fragment"><strong>Herding Effect</strong> - People follow the crowd without making their own informed decision.</li>
    <li class="fragment"><strong>Gambler's Fallacy</strong> - In many situations probabilities of repeated events are independent from each other. Often decision makers fail to understand this.</li>
    <li class="fragment"><strong>Default Effect</strong> - People tend to stick with pre-selected choices.</li>
    <li class="fragment"><strong>Overconfidence</strong> - People overestimate their abilities.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li class="fragment">Any other biases you know?</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>


Notes:

- Overconfidence: If asked, more than 50% of people think they drive above average.
  BUT has also positive effects.
  Sometimes overconfident people are better than others and statistically perform better in practice.
- Anchoring Effect
- Endowment Effect: This bias occurs when we overvalue something simply because we own it.
- Hindsight Bias - This is the tendency to believe, after an outcome is already known, that you would have predicted or could have foreseen the outcome. It is often referred to as the "I knew it all along" effect.
- Availability Bias - People make decisions based on the information that is readily available to them, rather than the complete data set. This bias can often lead to inaccurate conclusions.

# Classroom Discussions

Notes:

- Roughly 20 minutes

## Behavioral Biases

- Which biases might be responsible for the following situations?
- How can we mitigate the impact of those biases?

---

## Situation 1:

> Warren Buffett announces that he increased his exposure to Apple by buying more stocks.
> The price of AAPL goes up.

Notes:

- Herding effect
- Cannot be in the hope of a price response by Buffett's trade because it already happened.
- Self-fulfilling prophecy
- Maybe still rational?

---

## Situation 2:

> A stock investor bought a big position in Disney at around 100 USD per share.
> Then, the scandal unfolds and the price plummets.
> The investor keeps buying in at 80 USD, 50 USD and finally at 5 USD, 3 USD and 1 USD.
> When a friend asks him to stop he keeps arguing to recover the losses by "buying the dip" and to "further reducing the average buying price".

Notes:

- Sunk Cost Fallacy
- Learn to accept losses

---

## Situation 3:

> Peter wants to buy a new smartphone and fancies the new iPhone.
> Mentally, he is already looking forward to finally buy it, but a friend urges him to do some more research.
> He agrees and is reading through articles that pop up after googling "Why you should buy the new iPhone".

Notes:

- Confirmation Bias
- Mitigating by actively looking outside the echo-chamber that is just catering to your opinion.

---

## Situation 4:

> A Swiss energy company could increase the number of new renewable electricity contracts from 3% to 80-90% by pre-selecting the green option when customers were renewing their energy contracts.

Notes:

- Default effect
- Is it always good?
  People might consume more energy because they feel better about their contract, companies can exploit this effect "default to accept all cookies".

## Titan Submersible Incident

<ul>
    <li class="fragment">On 18 June 2023, Titan, a submersible operated by American tourism company OceanGate, imploded during an expedition to the Titanic wreck.</li>
</ul>

## Titan Submersible Incident

<ul>
    <li class="fragment">On board were Stockton Rush (OceanGate CEO), Paul-Henri Nargeolet (deep sea explorer), Hamish Harding and Shahzada Dawood (billionaire businessmen), and Suleman Dawood (Shahzada's son).</li>
    <li class="fragment">Communication was lost 1 hour and 45 minutes into the dive and the vessel failed to resurface later that day.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Four days later, a debris field containing parts of Titan was discovered near the Titanic.</li>
</ul>

---



## Prior Safety Concerns

<ul>
    <li class="fragment">Many industry experts had expressed safety concerns about Titan.</li>
    <li class="fragment">OceanGate, including CEO Rush, had not sought certification for Titan.</li>
    <li class="fragment">They published the following blog post to give reasoning:</li>
</ul>
<img src="../../../assets/img/2-Economics/2.1-ocean-gate-blog-post.png" alt="OceanGate Blogpost" style="width:600px; margin-right: 120px" class="fragment" />

Notes:
- What biases could be happening here?
- **Survivor bias**: is the logical error of concentrating on entities that passed a selection process while overlooking those that did not. This can lead to incorrect conclusions because of incomplete data.
- What bias are we facing maybe? **Hindsight Bias**: is the common tendency for people to perceive past events as having been more predictable than they were.

## Bitcoin Price Chart

<img src="../../../assets/img/2-Economics/2.1-bitcoin-price-chart.png" alt="Bitcoin Price Chart" style="width:800px; margin-right: 120px" />

> Based on what we‚Äôve discussed about market equilibrium, why might the price of Bitcoin have peaked at `~$68,000` in December 2021?
> What market dynamics would have to have been true to hit that peak, and then what might have changed for the price to drop to the current price of `$21,000` only 6 months later?

Notes:

- Open discussion with students.
  Answers to expect:
  - Price movement over time.
    I.e., the result of a Demand & Supply curve over time.
  - There is a shift in demand by expectations, (aggregated) income etc. all the previous factors that we described
  - Interestingly: Here is no shift in Supply if the protocol is seen as the producer of bitcoin!
    It is fixed.
    However, the supply on the market does change.
- This discussion will lead to discussing where the demand of a token comes from.
- Where does demand come from?
- Why should Bitcoin have value?

## Monopoly

- We have seen: Monopolists' market power leads to inefficient outcomes.
- Web 2.0 is full of firms that have a monopoly-like position in their respective domain:
  - Google
  - Uber
  - AirBnb
  - ...
- How do these firms exert their market power, if not over price-setting?

Notes:

- transparency? (stealing tips!)
- fees (uber, airbnb)
- surge pricing (uber)
- opaque auction mechanism (google in the case of online ads)

# Activities

---

## Activities Today & Tomorrow

- You can earn points by applying the concepts presented in this course to similar situations when playing with/against your colleagues.
- In session 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3, you can increase your budget (starting at 0) during several economic games.
- We have a total budget of $2250 for this.
- The budget is split between all the games that we play and total points earned by all of you are dynamically adjusted to correspond to the budget.
- In 2.3, there is a big final: You can use your earnings to bid for amazing NFTs by a professional artist in an experimental auction setting.

---

## Sign-in

- You will sign in to each of the games with your Polkadot wallet.
- You should always sign in with the same wallet to keep earning points to that wallet.
- Make sure not to forget your wallet credentials, because your final payout / NFT will be tied to that wallet.

---

## Disclaimer

1. If a bug occurs and the reward points are messed up or something else goes wrong, we may intervene.
2. We cannot help you recovering your Polkadot wallet. If you lose access, you need to create a new account in the games but you will lose previous earnings.

---

## Tracking your payoff

- Your balance is tracked in a wallet app.
- The points are translated to USD after each game.
- You can constantly check your balance by opening the wallet app link and sign in with your wallet.

Notes:

- Completely trusted and centralized xD
- If you leave your cookies you can simply log back in otherwise you need to log in again.

## Game 1: Ultimatum game

- You are randomly matched with another student in the classroom.
- The interaction is anonymous.
- Player 1 gets an endowment of 100 points.
- Player 1 can offer Player 2 between 0 and 100 points.
- Player 2 sees the offer and can decide to accept or reject the offer.
- If the offer is accepted, the endowment is split according to the offer.
- If the offer is rejected, both get 0 points.
- Budget for the game $500.
- There is no right or wrong here.
  It is your choice how to behave in this context!

## Let's start!

https://academy-games-polkadot.info/room/academy_ultimatum

---

## Game 1: Discussion

- What were your strategies here?
- What do you think we would expect from rational players?
- Why did people offer something?
- What did we measure here?

Notes:

- What would we expect from rational players (they do not know the concept of Nash Equilibrium yet but intuitively they can argue).
- What do you expect the data to look like?
- Did we measure fairness?
  No.
- How could we measure fairness?
  - Dictator game
- Talk about results in the literature:
  - Many people offer 40-50%
  - Almost nobody offers more than 50%
  - Many people reject below 30%
  - This is not only because of the stakes.
    There are experiments in Thailand and Indonesia where they play with half year salary.

## Game 2: Cournot Competition

- Economic model
- Firms compete by setting quantities
- Identical product
- Demand always meets supply
- Named after French mathematician Augustin Cournot.

Notes:

- Game 1: Cournot Competition with 2 firms (players from the audience) for 10 rounds

---

## Game 2: Overview

- Cournot competition (Duopoly!)
- 2 firms (you play 1 firm!)
- Each of you individually set a quantity to produce.
- All units are sold, but the price decreases in the quantity.
- Repeated over 10 rounds
- Points accumulate and are added to your budget.
- Budget for the game: $500

# Game 2: Questions?

---

## Let's start!

https://academy-games-polkadot.info/room/academy_cournot

---

## Game 2: Discussions

- What strategy did you employ?
- Did your behavior change over the rounds?
- What was the best choice for each firm?

Notes:

- Calculate equilibrium:
- $\pi = P(Q) * q$
- For Firm 1: $\pi = (60 - q_1 - q_2) * q_1$
- solve for optimal $q_1$ -> delta-pi / delta-q1 = -2q_1 - q_2 + 60 =! 0
- q_1\* = (60 - q_2) / 2
- q_2\* = (60 - q_1) / 2
- q1* = (60 - (60-q1*)/2) / 2
- = 30 - 15 + (q_1*/4) = q_1*
- = q_1* = q_2* = 20
- Show with example.
  If firm 1 plays 20 then 19 leads to smaller payoff and 21 for other firm.

## Conclusion

- We learned:
  - fundamental economic concepts that are important to navigate in daily life and the blockchain space.
  - the notion of rationality and what to expect from actors that behave this way.
  - that especially human individuals deviate from rationality and behave differently.
  - the importance of time on value.
  - to engage in economic situations with other human actors.
