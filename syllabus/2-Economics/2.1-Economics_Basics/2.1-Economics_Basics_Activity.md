### Activities Today & Tomorrow

- You can earn points by applying the concepts presented in this course to similar situations when playing with/against your colleagues.
- In session 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3, you can increase your budget (starting at 0) during several economic games.
- We have a total budget of $1800 for this. 
- The budget is split between all the games that we play and total points earned by all of you are dynamically adjusted to correspond to the budget. 
- In 2.3, there is a big final: You can use your earnings to bid for amazing NFTs by a professional artist in an experimental auction setting.
- Disclaimer: If a bug occurs and the reward points are messed up or something else goes wrong, we may intervene.

### Game 1: Ultimatum game

### Game 1: Discussion

- What were your strategies here?
- What do you think would we expect from rational players?
- Why did people offer something?
- What did we measure here?

Notes:
- What would we expect from rational players (they do not know the concept of Nash Equilibrium yet but intuitively they can argue).
- What do you expect the data to look like?
- Did we measure fairness? No.
- How could we measure fairness?
  - Dictator game
- Talk about results in the literature:
  - Many people offer 40-50%
  - Almost nobody offers more than 50%
  - Many people reject below 30%
  - This is not only because of the stakes. There are experiments in Thailand and Indonesia where they play with half year salary.
