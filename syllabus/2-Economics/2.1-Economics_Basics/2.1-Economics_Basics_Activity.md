### Activities Today & Tomorrow

- You can earn points by applying the concepts presented in this course to similar situations when playing with/against your colleagues.
- In session 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3, you can increase your budget (starting at 0) during several economic games.
- We have a total budget of $1800 for this. 
- The budget is split between all the games that we play and total points earned by all of you are dynamically adjusted to correspond to the budget. 
- In 2.3, there is a big final: You can use your earnings to bid for amazing NFTs by a professional artist in an experimental auction setting.
- Disclaimer: If a bug occurs and the reward points are messed up or something else goes wrong, we may intervene.

### Wallet creation

- Your balance is tracked in a wallet app.
- The points are translated to USD after each game.
- Create your wallet now here: https://otree.w3f.tech/room/academy_wallet
- Keep your seed phrase and do not share it with others!
- You can constantly check your balance by opening the wallet app link.

Notes:

- Completely trusted and centralized xD
- If you leave your cookies you can simply log back in otherwise you need your seed phrase.

### Everybody got a wallet?

### Make sure to have your Seed phrase for all games!

### Game 1: Ultimatum game

- You are randomly matched with another student in the classroom.
- The interaction is anonymous.
- Player 1 gets an endowment of 100 points.
- Player 1 can offer Player 2 between 0 and 100 points.
- Player 2 sees the offer and can decide to accept or reject the offer.
- If the offer is accepted, the endowment is split according to the offer.
- If the offer is rejected, both get 0 points.
- Budget for the game $400.

### Game 1: Discussion

- What were your strategies here?
- What do you think would we expect from rational players?
- Why did people offer something?
- What did we measure here?

Notes:
- What would we expect from rational players (they do not know the concept of Nash Equilibrium yet but intuitively they can argue).
- What do you expect the data to look like?
- Did we measure fairness? No.
- How could we measure fairness?
  - Dictator game
- Talk about results in the literature:
  - Many people offer 40-50%
  - Almost nobody offers more than 50%
  - Many people reject below 30%
  - This is not only because of the stakes. There are experiments in Thailand and Indonesia where they play with half year salary.

### Game 2: Cournot Competition

* Economic model
* Firms compete by setting quantities
* Identical product
* Demand always meets supply
* Named after French mathematician Augustin Cournot.

Notes:
- Game 1: Cournot Competition with 2 firms (players from the audience) for 10 rounds

---

### Game 2: Overview

* Cournot competition
* Budget for the game: $400
* 2 firms (you play 1 firm!)
* Each of you individually set a quantity to produce.
* All units are sold, but the price decreases in the quantity. 
* Repeated over 10 rounds
* Points accumulate and are added to your budget.

### Game 2: Discussions

- What strategy did you employ?
- Did your behavior change over the rounds?
- What was the best choice for each firm? 

Notes:
- Calculate equilibrium:
- $\pi = P(Q) * q$
- For Firm 1: $\pi = (60 - q_1 - q_2) * q_1$
- solve for optimal $q_1$ -> delta-pi / delta-q1 = -2q_1 - q_2 + 60 =! 0
- q_1* = (60 - q_2) / 2
- q_2* = (60 - q_1) / 2
- q1* = (60 - (60-q1*)/2) / 2 
- = 30 - 15 + (q_1*/4) = q_1*
- = q_1* = q_2* = 20
- Show with example. If firm 1 plays 20 then 19 leads to smaller payoff and 21 for other firm
