# 1. Introduction

---

> Game theory is the study of mathematical models of conflict and cooperation between intelligent and rational decision makers. Rational means that each individual’s decision-making behavior is consistent with the maximization of subjective expected utility. Intelligent means that each individual understands everything about the structure of the situation, including the fact that others are intelligent rational decision makers. (Roger Myerson, 1986)

---

* Early “game theoretic” research that still resonates today goes way back into the early 19th century:
    * 1838, Antoine Augustin Cournot: Cournot competition, uses an early, simplified version of Nash equilibrium.
    * 1881: Francis Edgeworth: trade with two consumers and two goods. 
    * 1913, Ernst Zermelo: chess, first formal application of backward induction.

Notes:
* Blockchain economics/tokenomics is all about understanding how people will act in situations where information and rules are transparent. 
* The economic study of how people will act given certain information is called ‘game theory’ and has been around for over a century. 
* We’ll cover the basics of game theory today, but let’s look through some of the core moments in this field so that you can go as deep as you’d like.

---

* The systematic study of games started in the 40/50s of the 20th century:
    * 1944: John von Neumann and Oscar Morgenstern publish *Theory of Games and Economic Behavior*.
    * 1949: John Nash writes his dissertation. His best known contribution  is on the general existence of a solution (the Nash equilibrium) for the important class of finite games.
    * 1963: Douglas Gale and Lloyd Shapley publish seminal work on matching.
    * 1973: John Harsanyi provides important insights into mixed strategies.
    * 1976: Robert Aumann publishes seminal work on common knowledge of rationality.

---

* Today, game theory is widely used not only in economics, but also in biology, sociology, political science, psychology, among others.
* In economics, game theory is used to analyze many different strategic situations. Examples include
    * Auctions.
    * Industrial economics.
    * Business administration.

---

* In the context of blockchains, game theoretic reasoning is used for:
    * Tokenomics: The specific design of how people interact in the ecosystem.
    * Consensus: Do the nodes in the network have the right incentives to follow the consensus protocol?

---

* Game theory is *abstract*:
    * Game theoretic models aim to get at the essence of a given strategic problem. This often requires that many facets of the problem are assumed away.
    * Pro: Abstraction makes the problem amenable to analysis and helps to identify the key incentives at work.
    * Con: A certain lack of realism.
* In any case: Modeling a strategic situation always entails a tradeoff between tractability and realism.

Notes:
- Need to explain what we mean by lack of realism:
    - Often people have more choices than we model.
    - Often people take other things into consideration when making choices than the model allows.
    - Often people know more/less than we assume.
- How to resolve the tradeoff between tractabiliy and realism is often subjective and depends on the taste of the modeler.

# 2. What is a Game?

---

A game is a strategic interaction between several players, where ...
1. ... all the possible *actions* of the players,
2. ... all the possible *outcomes*, and
3. ... how each combination of actions affects which outcome will realize ...

... are *common knowledge* among all the players of the game.

---

**Definition: Common Knowledge**

An event $X$ is common knowledge if if (1) everyone knows $X$, (2) everyone knows that everyone knows $X$, (3) everyone knows that everyone knows that everyone knows $X$, and so on ad infintum.

---

* Examples:
    * Auctions:
        * Actions: Bids.
        * Outcome: Winner and Payment.
    * Price-competition between firms:
        * Actions: Price charged.
        * Outcome: Demand for each firm, profit of each firm.
* Crucial feature of a game: outcome not only depends on own actions but also on the actions of the other players.

---

Traditionally, game theory distinguishes between

* static and dynamic games, as well as
* games of complete information and games of incomplete information.

---

| Static Game | Dynamic Game |
|---|---|
| All players take their actions at the same time | Players move sequentially and possibly multiple times, (at least partially) observing previous actions |
| Simple Example: Rock-Paper-Scissors. | Simple Example: Tic-Tac-Toe |
| Economic Example: Sealed-bid auction. All bidders submit their bids simultaneously (resp. in a sealed envelope). No player knows what others bid. | Economic Example: English auction. Auctioneer publicly raises price as long as at least one bidder accepts the price. |

---

| Game of Complete Information | Game of Incomplete Information |
|---|---|
| Preferences of the players are common knowledge. | Preferences are not common knowledge. |
| Simple Example: Tic-Tac-Toe. Both players prefer winning over losing. | Simple Example: TBD.|
| Economic Example: Competition between firms (assuming that all firms know other firms' costs). | Economic example: Most art auctions. People tend to have higly subjective preferences that they only know themselves. |

---

* Short quiz: Suppose three firms want to hire an engineer. 
    * The engineer brings added value to each firm of $300,000$ USD per year. 
    * The payoff of the firm is $300,000$ USD minus the salary. 
    * The payoff to the engineer is salary minus cost of working, which is known to everyone.
    * All firms make a salary offer at the same time. 
* Questions:
    1. Is this game static or dynamic? What would need to change in the description of the game such that it would fall in the other category?
    2. Is this game of complete or incomplete information? What would need to change in the description of the game such that it would fall in the other category?

Notes:
1. The game is static. For it to be dynamic, firms would need to make offers sequentially, *knowing what the firms before had offered*. 
2. The game is of complete information. To make information incomplete, we would need to have that the value of hiring the engineer differs between firms and is unknown between firms. Or that the cost of working for the engineer is not known to the firms. The point is that we need to have uncertainty over payoffs.
---

* This lecture focuses on static games of complete information.
* When we look at auctions in Session 3.3, we will also consider games of incomplete information, both dynamic and static.

---

# 3. Two well-known static games of complete information

---

## 3.1 Prisoners' Dilemma

* The Prisoner's Dilemma is one of the most famous games studied in game theory.
* The reason is that it points to a fundamental problem in certain strategic interactions: even though everyone knows that there is a socially optimal course of actions, no one will take it because they are rational utility maximizers.

---

* The usual story is about Bonnie and Clyde.
* Bonnie and Clyde are accused of robbing two banks. 
    * The evidence for the first robbery is overwhelming and will certainly lead to a conviction with two years of jail.
    * The evidence for the second robbery is not sufficient and the two will only be be convicted for that robbery in case of a confession by either or both.

---

* Bonnie and Clyde are interrogated in two different rooms, and both are offered the following:
    * If you both confess you will both go to jail for four years.
    * If you do not confess while your partner does, you will go to jail for five years (one additional year for obstruction of justice).
    * However, if you confess but your partner does not, then we reduce your jail time to one year.

---

* Bonnie and Clyde can either cooperate with each other (abbvreviated by C in the following) and not tell anything, or they can defect (D) and confess their crime.
 
![](https://i.imgur.com/ypcgb47.png)

---

* Consider Bonnie: 
    * If Clyde chooses C, she optimally chooses D.
    * If Clyde chooses D, she optimally chooses D.
* Choosing D is a *dominant strategy*: no matter what Clyde does, it is always the best choice.

![](https://i.imgur.com/oz2UuyT.png)

---

* The same holds true for Clyde.
* So, they end up both defecting, resulting in 4 years each.

![](https://i.imgur.com/T5aySON.png)

---

* Recap of the Bonnie and Clyde's Problem:
    * It would be in their best interest to cooperate and not to say anything. This would minimize the total jail time for the two.
    * However, both Bonnie and Clyde are rational utility maximizers.
    * So, they end up in a situation where they not only fare worse *individually* (4 instead of 2) but also *jointly* (the total jail time is 8 years rather than 4 years).

---

* Real-life examples: 
    * NATO and Russia in their arms race: Both prefer no arms race to an arms race. Yet, having some arms is preferrable to having no arms, irrespective whether to other one is armed.
    * OPEC / Cartels more general: Limiting oil supply is in the best interest of all. However, given the high price that thus results, everyone has an inentive to increase individual oil supply to maximize profits.
        * OPEC seems to overcome the Prisoners' Dilemma.
        * More on that later.

---

## 3.2 Coordination Game

* The predicition of play in the Prisoner's Dilemma was easy: both will defect. This is the optimal thing to do no matter what the other player does.
* In other games, predictions of play are not so clear.
* One instance is the coordination game.
* A coordination game is a type of simultaneous game in which a player will earn a higher payoff when they select the same course of action as another player.

---
* Consider the following coordination game with two players. 
* Either player can either choose $L$ or $R$.
* The numbers represent the payoffs a player receives. 
* We assume that both players prefer receiving more over receiving less.

* The players only obtain utility if they coordinate their actions.
* Examples:
    * Driving on the right/left side of the road.
    * Money adoption.
    * Standard adoption.

* The coordination game has two outcomes (L,L) and (R,R) that stand out.
* Clearly, the following is true for both players: "If the other player chooses $L$ ($R$), then it is optimal for me to also choose $L$ ($R$)."
* That is, for both players it holds:
    * Playing L is a *best response* to the other player playing L.
    * Playing R is a *best response* to the other player playing R.
* So, in the outcomes (L,L) and (R,R) the players choose *mutually optimal actions*.

---

* Both (L,L) and (R,R) are instances of *Nash equilibrium*. 
* **Definition: Nash Equilibrium**. A combination of actions such that all players choose optimally *given* the actions of the other players.
* By their very nature, coordination games always have multiple equilibria.
* The outcome (Defect,Defect) in the Prisoner's dilemma is the *unique* Nash equilibrium.

---

* So, which outcome does the theory of Nash equilibrium predict in the coordination game?
* Answer: neiter. 
* Also, sometimes people switch between equilibria (if they are made to)...

---

## 3.3 Schelling Points

* While the theory of Nash equilibrium does not provide a clear prediction of play in the coordination game, other theories sometimes do.
* A prominent one is the theory of so-called *Schelling points*.
* A Schelling point (aka focal point) is a solution that people tend to choose by default in the absence of communication. 
* The concept was introduced by the American economist Thomas Schelling in his book The Strategy of Conflict (1960).

---

* Schelling ran a couple of informal experiments in which he asked his students: 
> If you are to meet a stranger in New York City, but you cannot communicate with the person, then when and where will you choose to meet? 
* This is a coordination game. Literally *any* point and time is a Nash equilibrium. 
* However, most people responded: noon at (the information booth at) Grand Central Terminal.
* Basic idea: in case of multiple equilibria, social norms may help to choose one.

---

## 3.4 Summary and Discussion

---

* What have we done so far?
    * Typology of games: static/dynamic and complete/incomple information.
    * Two canonical games: Prisoner's Dilemma and Coordination game.
    * The Prisoner's Dilemma has a unique Nash equilibrium whereas the Coordiation game has two Nash equilibria.
    * To select among multiple equilibria, the notion of a *Schelling*  point is sometimes invoked.

---

* Discussion: Why is having a unique Nash equilibrium or a Schelling point important for us?
    * Nash Equilibria are used to predict the behavior of others in a closed system, like a blockchain. 
    * If you can identify the unique Nash Equilibrium or the Schelling point in a system, you have a strong prediction of user behavior. 
    * So, you can begin to drive user behavior by designing incentives accordingly.

# 4. Public Goods and the Tragedy of the Commons

---

## 4.1 Public-Good Game

* What is a public good? 
    * Non-rivalrous: My consumption does not affect yours.
    * Non-excludable: No-one can be exluded from consumption.
* Examples:
    * Fireworks
    * Polkadot's Public Good Parachains
* Let's model the basic concepts in a game.

---

* Consider a game with three players that we index by $i=1,2,3$.
* All players have some endowment, e.g., 10 US Dollars.
* Each player $i$ can choose how much to contribute, $c_i$, to the public good.
* The consumption value of the public good is $\alpha (c_1+c_2+c_3)$ with $\alpha < 1$.
    * The value of the public good increases with the amount of contributions.
    * Every player (regardless of the contribution) will consume the public good.

---

* Let us write down the payoffs of the players.
* Each player $i$ contributes an amount $c_i \in [0,10]$.
* The payoff function of each player $i$ is 
$$10 - c_i + \alpha (c_1+c_2+c_3)$$ 


---

* How would you interpret $\alpha$ ?
* How would you interpret $3\alpha$?
* What would be the best for the collective?

Notes:
* $\alpha$ is the private marginal benefit of contributing to the public good.
* $3\alpha$ is the social marginal benefit (there are three players!).

---

* The optimum for the collective maximizes total welfare, 

$$3\cdot 10 - (c_1-c_2-c_3) + 3\alpha (c_1-c_2-c_3) = 30 - (1-3\alpha)(c_1-c_2-c_3).$$

* Clearly, if $3\alpha > 1$, then it is socially optimal if everyone contributes, $c_i = 10$.
* Observe: $3\alpha>1$ means that the marginal social benefit of the joint conributions is higher than the marginal social cost of the contributions.

---

* Is the socially optimal behavior an individually optimal strategy here?
    * No. We have $\alpha<1$. 
    * So, the individual payoff $$10 - c_i + \alpha (c_1+c_2+c_3)$$ is always maximized when not contributing at all.
* Observe: Not contribution is a *dominant strategy*.
* So, if $1/3 < \alpha < 1$, then our public good game really is a prisoner's dilemma with more than two players: it is sociall optimal for everyone to contribute but not contributing is a dominant strategy for everyone.
* Question: What if $\alpha>1$? $\alpha < 1/3$.

Notes:
* If $\alpha > 1$, then the individual marginal benefit is always higher than the individual marginal cost, and it becomes a dominant strategy for all players to fully invest in the public good. Then, there would be no public goods problem...
* If $\alpha < 1/3$, there is no public good problem, either. It is socially and individually optimal not to contribute.

---

What about empirical evidence?
* What do you think happens when playing this with real humans...
    * ... for one round?
    * ... for many rounds?
    * ... when allowing for communication?
    * ... with different sizes of the groups?

Notes: 
* No contribution when played for one round.
* Some little contribution but quickly to 0.
* Some longer and stronger contribution but eventually going to 0 quickly
* The more people the higher the perceived possibility to free ride.

---

* Polkadot solves the underprovision of a public good with a subsidy.
    * Parachains that offer functionality / utility to all users but struggle to find a business case can receive a slot for free and are subsidized by grants.
    * These are parachains that would be too expensive to develop individually but that provide large benefit for the overall ecosystem.

---

* How do parachains fit our simple model?
    * $\alpha$: benefit to you for every US dollar that you invest into the development of the parachain.
    * $\alpha < 1$: you make a loss of $(1-\alpha)$ for every US Dollar invested.
    * If you get a grant, then Polkadot covers a large proportion of your costs.
    * Now that most of your investment gets refunded, you make a benefit $\alpha$ per USD invested.
    * So, it is optimal for you to invest (even though noone else does).
    

---

## 4.2 Tragedy of the Commons

* Tragedy of the commons is related to public good provision.
* Common good:
    * Rivalrous: My consumption reduces your possibility to consume.
    * Non-exludable: Noone can be excluded from consuming the good.
* Recall: Public good was *non*-rivalrous. 
* Examples of a common good:
    * Public park: anyone can go; too many people spoil the experience.
    * Coffee machine in the office: anyone can use it; too many users may cause congestion.


---

* So, the main difference to a public good is that in a common good your consumption reduces the value of the good to others.
* This is called a *consumption externality* that you impose on others (and others impose on you.)
* The *tragedy of the commons* is that, because you do not take this externality into account, consumption is higher than would be socially optimal.

---

* An example is (Over-)Fishing: 
    * Fishing gives private benefit but might destroy the broader ecosystem, which has its own value for everyone (due to, e.g., tourism). 
    * Because individual fishermen do not have to pay for the damage they cause to the broader ecosystem, they will individually fish too much.
* Air pollution by industry is also an example: 
    * Producing a good yields private profit but reduces air quality for everyone. 
    * Because there is no price attached to air quality, the firms do not have to pay for its reduction and, hence, will produce too much.
    
---

* Another example is Bitcoin: 
    * Mining gives private benefit in the form of mining rewards but hampers environment for everyone. 
    * Again, because there is no price attached to damamging the environment, the miners do not take this into consideration and, hence, will mine too much.
* Important: 
    * In neither of these examples is it the case that there should be no fishing/production/mining! After all there are always benefits to these activities.
    * The tragedy of the commons is that the externality is not priced into these activities, driving them to inefficeintly high levels.    
    
---

* We analyze the tragedy of the commons in a simple model. 
* There is a resource of size $K$ and two players.
* Each player enjoys consuming $k_i$ but both also enjoy the remaining resource $K-k_1-k_2$.
* That is, each player derives utility from consumption, but gets hurt by the consumption of the other player.
* Utility of player $1$: $u_1(k_1,k_2) = \ln(k_1)+\ln(K-k_1-k_2).$ 
* Utility of player $2$: $u_2(k_1,k_2) = \ln(k_2)+\ln(K-k_1-k_2).$

Notes:
* You don't need to be able to solve this game on your onw, but we want you to have at least seen such a model once.
* The specific form of the utility function; i.e., the ln, is not necessary but will make the computations easy. 
* We could replace the natural log with any increasing and concave function; but we then almost certainly won't be able to fully solve the model.

---

* In this game a Nash equilibrium is a vector of consumption choices, $(k_1^*,k_2^*)$, such that $k_1^*$ is optimal given $k_2^*$ and vice versa. 
* The way to solve for the Nash equilibrium is as follows:
    1. Fix consumption of player $2$, $k_2$, and try to characterize the optimal choice of player $1$.
    2. Fix the consumption of player $1$, $k_1$, and try to characterize the best response of player $2$.
    3. Find $(k_1,k_2)$ such that both players play a best reponse to each other.
    
---

* Fix consumption of player $2$, $k_2$, and find player $1$'s best response $BR_1(k_2)$.

$$\frac{\partial u_1(k_1,k_2)}{\partial k_1} = 0 \iff \frac{1}{k_1} =\frac{1}{K-k_1-k_2} \iff k_1 = \frac{1}{2}[K-k_2] \equiv BR_1(k_2).$$

* Fix consumption of player $1$, $k_1$, and find player $2$'s best response $BR_2(k_1)$.

$$\frac{\partial u_2(k_1,k_2)}{\partial k_2} = 0 \iff \frac{1}{k_2} =\frac{1}{K-k_1-k_2} \iff k_2 = \frac{1}{2}[K-k_1] \equiv BR_2(k_1).$$

---

* So, a Nash equilibrium $(k_1^*,k_2^*)$ consists of mutual best responses,

\begin{align}
k_1^* &= BR_1(k_2^*) \\
k_2^* &= BR_2(k_1^*)
\end{align}

* In other words, we seek to find $(k_1^*,k_2^*)$ that solve 

\begin{align}
k_1^* &= \frac{1}{2}[K-k_2^*] \\
k_2^* &= \frac{1}{2}[K-k_1^*]
\end{align}

* Solution: $k_1^*=k_2^*= K/3.$

---

* What is the tragedy here? Players consume more than the socially optimal amount.
* How do we compute the socially optimal amount? 
* We maximize total welfare $W(k_1,k_2)=u_1(k_1,k_2)+u_2(k_1,k_2)$ by choosing $k_1$ and $k_2$.
* The optimality conditions to this problem are as follows:

\begin{align}
\frac{\partial W(k_1,k_2)}{\partial k_1} = 0 &\iff \frac{1}{k_1} =\frac{2}{K-k_1-k_2} \iff k_1 = \frac{1}{3}[K-k_2] \\
\frac{\partial W(k_1,k_2)}{\partial k_2} = 0 &\iff \frac{1}{k_2} =\frac{2}{K-k_1-k_2} \iff k_1 = \frac{1}{3}[K-k_2]
\end{align}

* Solution: $\hat k_1 = \hat k_2 = K/4$.

---

* The socially optimal consumption level is *lower* than the mutually optimal one.
* Why? Consumption externality: each player inflicts harm on the other player when consuming but does not take this into account for the individually optimal decision.
* What about utilities?

\begin{align}
u_1(k_1^*,k_2^*) &= \ln(K/3)+\ln(K/3) = \ln(K^2/9) \\
u_1(\hat k_1,\hat k_2) &= \ln(K/4) + \ln(K/2) = \ln(K^2/8) 
\end{align}

* Both players would be better off in the social optimum.

---

* Traditional solutions to the tragedy of the commons: 
    * Taxes: The government requires both players to pay a tax $\tau\cdot k_i$, where $\tau > 0$ is the tax rate. This way, consumption becomes more expensive, leading to a reduction.
    * Licenses: The government might charge a fee $F> 0$ to consume in the first place and then redistributes the proceeds again among the affected parties. 

---

## 4.3 Summary

---

* What have we done in this section?
    * Compared public and common goods and their respective problems.
    * Both feature non-excludable consumption.
    * Public good features non-rivalrous consumption whereas the common good features rivalrous consumption.

---

* Both the public good and the common good are characterized by a distinct externality.
* The public good features a (positive) production externality: I profit from your production (and you do so from mine).
    * This might lead to underproduction, because individual marginal benefits from the good are lower than the social marginal benefits.
* The common good features a (negative) consumption externality: I impose a loss on you through my consumption (and vice versa).
    * This might lead to a tragedy of the commons, which is characterized by inefficiently high consumption.

# Classroom Discussions

Notes:
- roughly 30 minutes

## Classroom Discussion: Open-source

> Providing open-source software is like contributing to a public good and the community will therefore sooner or later collapse.

## Classroom Discussion: Prisoner's Dilemma?

* Read this article: https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-bitcoin-dilemma.
* Discuss why the "Bitcoin Dilemma" is probably not a Prisoner's' Dilemma (as claimed).

Notes:
* Why the task?
    * It reinforces the concepts of cooperative and non-cooperative games as well as concepts of complete and incomplete information (does it? Or do we need to make it more explicit).
    * It reinforces the concept of the prisonner's dilemma
    * It challenges students to apply their knowledge to the blockchain space.

# Workshop: Games

Notes:
- roughly 70 minutes

## Guessing Game

* We divide the classroom into three groups and play a guessing game.
* The budget for this game per group is: TODO.
* The game is simple: You win when you correctly guessed 2/3 of the average guesses.
* We repeat the game for ten rounds. 
* Three different group sizes: 10, 20 and 30.

## Prisoner's Dilemma

* You play a Prisoner's Dilemma (groups of 2) over 10 rounds.
* You will be randomly matched to another student in the class.
* Budget for this game: TODO
* You have the option to chat between rounds.
    * Note: Keep the chat civil and do not reveal any identifying information about yourself.

## Public Good Game

* We will play a public good game as presented in the lecture.
* Budget for this game: TODO
* Groups of 4 over 10 periods.
* The efficiency factor is 1.6 - (that is 4 * 0.4, which is the social marginal benefit as we discussed before).
* With one additional mechanism: After each round each player sees the contributions of the other players and can decide to deduct points from them (at own costs).
