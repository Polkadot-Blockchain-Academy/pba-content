## Goals

Let’s completely reframe all of our thoughts about what it is we are building.

Let’s talk about:

1. Web3
1. The World Computer
1. Components of the World Computer
1. The Web3 Internet
1. Products for the World Computer

## What is Web3?

It is hard to describe Web3 to new people with a single punchy line.

Here are a few tries:

- *Less trust, more truth.*
- *A more equitable version of the internet.*
- *Resilient public digital infrastructure.*

> The best way is to look at the problems Web3 is trying to solve…

## A Simple Set of Conjectures

- Central authorities will always (eventually) abuse their powers.
- With the increasing globalization caused by technology, the reach of central authorities is greater than ever.
- Computers play a critical role in providing public digital infrastructure.
- We could create a world more resilient from these powers, if the worlds public digital infrastructure were itself more decentralized and resilient.
- Web3 describes that resilient public digital infrastructure.

## History has shown us that we cannot trust centralized authorities.

<pba-col>

### Wikileaks Censorship (2010)

Governments and financial institutions cut off funding channels to WikiLeaks, blocking donations via traditional systems like PayPal and credit cards.

</pba-col>
<pba-col>

### Snowden Revelations (2013)

Exposed global surveillance programs conducted by the NSA and its allies, showing how governments and centralized entities were collecting and storing vast amounts of private data without consent.

## Why we need Web3: 10 Historical Events

LLM Generated:

<pba-cols style="font-size: 20px;">

1. The **2008 financial crisis** underscored the need for transparent and permissionless financial systems, which is the goal of DeFi.
1. The **Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal** revealed how centralized platforms exploit user data, highlighting the need for decentralized identity and user data ownership.
1. The **financial blockade of WikiLeaks** by major payment processors demonstrated how centralized entities can censor access to funds, proving the case for permissionless cryptocurrencies.
1. The **Robinhood/GameStop trading halts** showed how centralized brokers can intervene in markets, emphasizing the need for decentralized exchanges (DEXs) with transparent rules.
1. The arbitrary **de-platforming and demonetization of creators by platforms** like YouTube illustrates the need for censorship-resistant social networks where users own their audience.

</pba-col>
<pba-col>

1. Massive **data breaches at Equifax and Yahoo** exposed the vulnerability of centralizing sensitive information, arguing for systems where users control their own private data.
1. **Government-led internet shutdowns** in countries like Turkey and Egypt prove the fragility of centralized networks and the need for decentralized, censorship-resistant communication.
1. **High platform fees** on sites like Substack and Patreon show how intermediaries extract value, highlighting the need for direct creator-to-fan monetization with lower costs.
1. **Opaque algorithms on centralized platforms** that manipulate user feeds underscore the need for open systems where users can control their own information and engagement.
1. **Twitter's suppression of links** to its competitor Substack is a clear example of a dominant platform stifling competition, showing the need for a neutral social protocol.

<pba-cols style="font-size: 20px;">
<pba-col>

1. Your social media feed is controlled by a secret algorithm that prioritizes engagement over your well-being or exposure to a balanced viewpoint.
1. Every time you use a "free" online service, your personal data is being collected, packaged, and sold to advertisers without you getting a share of the profit.
1. A creator you follow on a major platform suddenly loses their income overnight because of an arbitrary change in monetization or content policy.
1. You are required to create a new account and password for every single online service, leading to dozens of insecure credentials scattered across centralized databases.
1. Your bank or a payment app can freeze your account or block a transaction based on their internal risk models, with little transparency or immediate recourse.

</pba-col>
<pba-col>

1. You "purchase" a digital item like an ebook, movie, or in-game skin, but you don't truly own it and can't resell it or move it to another platform.
1. News organizations and independent journalists are constantly at risk of being de-ranked, demonetized, or censored by centralized platforms that control information flow.
1. Making an international payment involves multiple intermediary banks, each taking a fee and adding days of delay to the transaction.
1. Developers are forced to build on platforms like the App Store or Google Play, where the platform owner takes a large cut (e.g., 30%) and can remove the app at will.
1. Your digital identity is fragmented across dozens of companies, with none of them giving you a complete, portable, and verifiable record of your own online life.

# Origins of the World Computer

## What is the World Computer?

**The “World Computer” is a single, globally accessible, and trustless computing platform that is not owned or controlled by any single entity.**

It's a computer formed by a decentralized network of participants whose job is to agree on the state of the system and execute programs exactly as written, making the rules of an application algorithmically enforceable.

> It is the backbone of the resilient public digital infrastructure imagined by Web3.

## Origins of the World Computer

<div class="flex-container">

<div class="left-small">

<img src="./img/gav-world-computer.png" />

</div>
<div class="right">

- The origins of Web3 and the World Computer come from the same place: Dr. Gavin Wood.
- Our ability to picture what exactly that looked like has changed as the tools and technology around us has matured.
- Likely it will continue to evolve.
- **But is Ethereum actually a good measure of what a World Computer would look like?**

</div>
</div>

## Turing Completeness

<div class="flex-container">

<div class="left-small">

<img style="width: 600px;" src="./img/turing.png" />

</div>
<div class="right">

- Ethereum claimed to be a computer because it was “turing complete”.
- Turing completeness is a poor test of being a “useful computer”.
- Most smart contract blockchains have achieved turing completeness, but are not designed as a computer.
- They are also arguably not very turing complete because of execution limits.
- So what are they?

</div>
</div>

---

## Distributed Ledger Technology


<div class="flex-container">

<div class="left-small">

<img style="width: 400px;" src="./img/spreadsheet.png" />

<img style="width: 400px;" src="./img/lambda.png" />

</div>
<div class="right">

- Most blockchains are just building DLTs.
	- Bitcoin, XRP, BNB, Solana, etc…
- The Web3 version of a spreadsheet.
	- Excel was designed for storing data.
	- Lambda functions gave Excel turing completeness and programmability.
		- Equivalent to Smart contracts.
- Can be scripted, and can emulate a computer, but is not designed for this.
- All intermediate state and functions result in updates to the ledger.
- Building apps for DLTs, feels like building apps in Excel: **you can do it, but it doesn’t feel right.**

</div>
</div>

## Two Different Products

Both Built Using Blockchain Technology

<pba-cols class="text-small">
<pba-col>

#### Distributed Ledger Technology

- The primary purpose is to **store** data.
- The primary part of this product is the blockchain state.
- The backbone of decentralized finance.
- A proven product, that has clear market demand.

</pba-col>
<pba-col>

#### Decentralized Computers

- The primary purpose is to **execute** computation.
- The primary part of this product is the decentralized computation bandwidth.
- The backbone of the decentralized internet.
- A speculative product, not necessarily focused on market demand, but on a future we need.

</pba-col>
</pba-cols>

Now we can start to see why some blockchain products seem so different.

# Components of the World Computer

---

## The World Computer is “Virtual”

<div class="flex-container">

<div class="left-small">

<img style="width: 400px;" src="./img/web3-cloud.png" />

<img style="width: 400px;" src="./img/decentralized.png" />

</div>
<div class="right">

- It is important to remember we are discussing a “virtual machine” rather than a physical one.
- Applications generally do not have visibility of the decentralized/distributed nature of the computer.
- The fact that the World Computer runs across many real computers gives it many Web3 properties.
	- Even more when the network is permissionless, open, borderless, etc…
- The glue which turns many computers into one is the “Consensus algorithm”, which achieves byzantine fault tolerance.

</div>
</div>

---

## Decentralized Components

Many components of the decentralized computer can be compared to a physical computer.

<div class="text-small">

- Distributed, Decentralized Hard Drive
	- Introduced by Bitcoin: Merklized Blockchain State
- Decentralized Single-Core Processor
	- Introduced by Ethereum: EVM
	- Other VM options exist today, as do other physical processor choices.
- Decentralized, Threaded, Single-Core Processor
	- Introduced(?) by Solana: Some parallel transactions, but not sharded execution.
- Decentralized Multi-Core Processor
	- Introduced by Polkadot: Execution Sharding
- Decentralized Memory (Non-Persistent Storage)
	- Introduced (naively) by Polkadot: PVF Data Availability, not easily accessible for general use.
	- Introduced (externally) by teams like Celestia: Very slow, like USB thumb drive as RAM.
	- Introduced (properly) by JAM: General purpose decentralized distributed data lake.

</div>

---

## Entirely New Components

Some components in the decentralized computer have no parallel to the physical computer.

<div class="text-small">

- Consensus Layer
	- Required to achieve “consensus” across the computer.
		- Includes the properties of Economic Security and Finality / Canonicalization.
		- Proof of Work, ELVES, ZK Rollup, Optimistic Rollup.
- Economic / Incentives Layer
	- Used to allow the computer to access and influence the physical world.
- On-Chain Governance
	- Used to allow the physical world to access and influence the computer.

</div>

---

## Further Beyond

We can simply hypothesize about the other parts of a computing world which are useful today, but are only available via centralized solutions:

<div class="text-small">

- Decentralized GPUs
	- highly parallel, optimized for performing many simple operations at once
- Privacy Solutions
	- Mixnets
	- ZK Privacy Layers
- Internet
	- Trustless Bridges
- Data Centers
	- The “Grid”: Omniledger + Bridges
- More?

## Who does the World Computer appeal to?

The World Computer has many properties, appealing to different audiences:

- A Distributed Computer
	- a distributed computer is one which has natural fallback, and can provide incredible uptime and replication guarantees.
- A Verifiable Computer
	- a verifiable computer is one where people need not require trust in the platform or the other users they interact with.
- A Resilient Computer
	- a resilient computer is one where applications and services need not worry about the restrictions / laws of any particular nation, and can launch unstoppable applications.
- A Financial Computer
	- a platform which natively integrates global finances into your platform, and enables direct integration between you and your customers.

## Costs of the World Computer

The World Computer will not replace your personal computer; it's a new type of machine for a different class of problems.

- It is inherently slower and more expensive.
	- Every calculation must be independently verified by thousands of nodes across the globe.
- It is a finite public resource.
	- Access isn't always guaranteed to everyone, and when there is competition, you need to pay.
	- However, we hope to scale to a point where everyone gets some amount of basic access.
- It is permanent and immutable by design.
	- The history of the computer will reflect all of the actions of the past.
- It shifts the security burden entirely to the user.
	- Full sovereignty.
- There is no "forgot password" link, support hotline, etc…
