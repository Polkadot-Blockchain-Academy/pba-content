## Introduction to Formal Methods

#### _Story Time!_

---v

### _Ariane 5 Rocket - Flight 501_

<img rounded style="width: 400px" src="./img/ariane.jpg" />

- in **1996**, the launcher rocket disintegrated 39 secs after take-off.
- **Failure**: An _overflow_, caused by a conversion from 64-bit to 16-bit floating point
- **Mistake**: reusing inertial reference platform of Ariane-4, where overflow cannot happen due to different operational conditions
- **Cost**: `$`500M payload, `$`8B development program

## Software Correctness is _very_ important

> Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs,<br/>but never to show their absence!
>
> --Edgard Dijkstra--

**_Hence, the necessity to go beyond testing_** <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---v

## Formal Methods to the Rescue!

- Given a system (code) and Specification (behavior), verify/prove correctness with reasonable mathematical guarantees.
- **Traditionally**, costs and efforts were justifiable in _safety-critical_ software like avionics, nuclear reactors, medical imaging, etc.
- however, things have changed ...

Notes:

this is how Formal Methods were motivated; to prove the absence of Bugs! A bit of fear-mongering in my opinion.

---v

## It is no longer Rocket Science!

- AWS formally verifies Key-Value storage nodes in Amazon S3 (Rust Implementation).
- Meta detects resource leaks and race conditions in Android apps
- Uber uses static analysis to find Null-pointer exceptions
- Ethereum's Beacon chain and Tendermint consensus formally verified for safety and liveness guarantees

Notes:

- Personally think of formal methods as a more systematic way of detecting bugs.
- Ideally, verifying if your property holds on all possible inputs.

---v

## Formal Methods Today

From being theoretical research interests<br/> to delivering practical cost-effective tools

<pba-flex center>

- goals more focused, promises less lofty
- verification tools more efficient
- combination of analysis techniques

</pba-flex>

Notes:

- Limiting attention to a particular class of bugs, resource leaks, data-races, etc.
- Drastic Speed-up in Underlying Constraint-Solver engines.
  For example, Z3 by microsoft, can solve constraints with billions of variables.
- Unified theory with blurring lines; Combining both static and dynamic techniques.

---v

## More like _Light-weight Formal Methods_

1. Rigorously **detecting bugs** → proving overall correctness of system.
1. Developer-centric **Usability** (e.g. workflow integration)

Notes:

- Realized the importance of Developer experience.
- No more obscure logic that the developer has to learn to write specifications.
- You will see how intuitive it is to verify code.

---v

## Formal Methods ↔ Blockchains

**Hammer finally found the nail!**

- Lot at stake, justifies the cost and efforts
- Business logic is compact and modular, within limits

Note:

- Reputation along with money at stake.
- A simple android app has 100k java classes.
  Techniques are not scalable on large codebases.
- Complexity of runtime business logic is magnitude lower.
  Lot of interest in Smart Contract verification.
- Check out Certora, Echidna, Securify, and more [here](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/formal-verification/)

## Key Takeaways

<pba-flex center>

**_Formal Methods are..._**

- **Not a Panacea** but can improve software quality
- Getting more and more **accessible**
- Useful for increasing **reliability and security** of blockchains

#### Quint/ State-Right (Model-checkers)

- Humongous effort modelling the system & specifying properties
- Abstraction gap
- Reason about complex properties: safety & liveness of consensus mechanism

</pba-col>
</pba-cols>

Notes:

- Design-level, verifying protocol design.
- Always a discrepancy in your model and actual code.
- Safety: nothing bad ever happens; no two honest nodes agree on different state
- Liveness: something good eventually happens; eventually 2/3rds reach consensus

#### Static Analyzers

- Code-level
- Information/ dataflow properties; access control for code;
- Specify expected behavior (properties).
  Roundtrip property: decode (encode (x)) == x
- Default checks: bugs like arithmetic overflow, out-of-bound access panics

</pba-col>
</pba-cols>

Notes:

- Eg. for code access control: ensure that certain sensitive parts of runtime are only accessible by Root origin
- MIRAI is developed by Meta uses technique called abstract interpretation;
  specifically useful for detecting panics statically and information flow properties
- Kani: we will dive deeper soon

Notes:

- [Substrace](https://github.com/KaiserKarel/substrace) is a linter specifically for Substrate
- Flowistry allows you to track dependency between variables; slices only the relevant portion for a given location.

# Our Focus: [Kani](https://github.com/model-checking/kani)

---

## Kani: Model Checking tool for Rust

- [Open-source Rust verifier](https://github.com/model-checking/kani) by AWS
- Underlying technique used: Bounded Model Checking
- Can be used to _prove_:
  - Absence of arithmetic overflows
  - Absence of runtime errors (index out of bounds, panics)
  - User Specified Properties (enhanced PropTesting)
  - Memory safety when using unsafe Rust
- Provides a concrete test-case triggering the bug if verification fails

Notes:

Link to Bounded Model Checking paper for interested folks [here](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~emc/papers/Books%20and%20Edited%20Volumes/Bounded%20Model%20Checking.pdf).
For example when you are accessing/modifying mutable static variable

## Proof Harness

<pba-col centre>

```rust
use my_crate::{function_under_test, meets_specification, precondition};

#[kani::proof]
fn check_my_property() {
   // Create a nondeterministic input
   let input = kani::any();

   // Constrain it according to the function's precondition
   kani::assume(precondition(input));

   // Call the function under verification
   let output = function_under_test(input);

   // Check that it meets the specification
   assert!(meets_specification(input, output));
}
```

<!-- .element: style="font-size:0.62em"-->

- Kani tries to prove that all valid inputs produce outputs that meet specifications, without panicking.
- Else, Kani generates a trace that points to the failure.

</pba-col>

Property: `decode(encode(x)) == x`

<pba-cols>
<pba-col center>

Test

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
fn test_u32 {
  let val: u16 = 42;
  assert_eq!(u16::decode(&mut
    val.encode()[..]).unwrap(), val)
}
```

fixed value `42`

</pba-col>

<pba-col center>

Fuzzing

```rust
#[cfg(fuzzing)]
fuzz_target!(|data: &[u8]|) {
  let val = u16::arbitrary(data);
  assert_eq!(u16::decode(&mut
    val.encode()[..]).unwrap(), val)
}
```

multiple random values of `u16`

</pba-col>
</pba-cols>

<pba-col center>

Kani Proof

```rust
#[cfg(kani)]
#[kani::proof]
fn proof_u32_roundtrip {
  let val: u16 = kani::any();
  assert_eq!(u16::decode(&mut
    val.encode()[..]).unwrap(), val)
}
```

verifies exhaustively all values of `u16`
</pba-col>

---v

### Under the Hood: Bounded Model Checking

#### Idea:

- Search for counterexamples in (bounded) executions paths
- However, this search is an NP-hard problem

#### Method:

- Efficiently reduce problem to a Constraint Satisfaction (SAT) problem
- verification reduced to problem of searching satisfiable assignment to a SAT formula.
- leverages highly optimized SAT solvers making the search tractable.

Notes:

Kani uses miniSAT as the backend engine; a lot of other verification tools use Z3 solver.

---v

### Translation to constraints

<pba-cols>

<pba-col centre>

#### Code

```rust
fn foo(x: i32) -> i32 {
    let mut y: i32 = 8;
    let mut w: i32 = 0;
    let mut z: i32 = 0;
    if x != 0 {
        z -= 1;
    } else {
        w += 1;
    }
    assert!(z == 7 || w == 9);
    w+z
}
```

</pba-col>

<pba-col centre>

#### Constraints

```rust
y = 8,
z = x? y-1: 0,
w = x? y+1: 0,
z != 7 /\ w != 9 (negation of the assert condition)
```

- Constraints fed into a Solver (minisat)
- For no value of `x` the constraints hold $\implies$ Assert conditions verified
- Else the solver found a failing test (counterexample)

<!-- show the number of clauses and variables used in the formula in the demo-->

</pba-col>
</pba-cols>

## How does it handle loops?

- _Bounded_ in BMC to the rescue!
- Loops are unwound up to a certain bounded depth $k$, else the verification does not terminate.
- Determining the _sweet-spot_ $k$ is a trade-off between _tractability_ and _verification confidence_ .

---v

## Demo: Unwinding Loops

```rust
fn initialize_prefix(length: usize, buffer: &mut [u8]) {
    // Let's just ignore invalid calls
    if length > buffer.len() {
        return;
    }

    for i in 0..=length {
        buffer[i] = 0;
    }
}

#[cfg(kani)]
#[kani::proof]
#[kani::unwind(1)] // deliberately too low
fn check_initialize_prefix() {
    const LIMIT: usize = 10;
    let mut buffer: [u8; LIMIT] = [1; LIMIT];

    let length = kani::any();
    kani::assume(length <= LIMIT);

    initialize_prefix(length, &mut buffer);
}
```

<!-- .element: style="font-size:0.62em"-->

---v

## Dealing with Loops: Summary

**Process:**

- Start with unwinding $k$ times
- If no bug is found, increase $k$ until either:
  - A bug is found
  - verifier times-out
  - predetermined upper-bound $N$ for $k$ is reached

---v

## Implementing Arbitrary for custom type

```rust
use arbitrary::{Arbitrary, Result, Unstructured};

#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug)]
pub struct Rgb {
    pub r: u8,
    pub g: u8,
    pub b: u8,
}

impl<'a> Arbitrary<'a> for Rgb {
    fn arbitrary(u: &mut Unstructured<'a>) -> Result<Self> {
        let r = u8::arbitrary(u)?;
        let g = u8::arbitrary(u)?;
        let b = u8::arbitrary(u)?;
        Ok(Rgb { r, g, b })
    }
}
```

## Exercise

> Verify [Fixed-width](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-scale-codec/blob/master/src/codec.rs) & [Compact](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-scale-codec/blob/master/src/compact.rs) Encoding for integer types in SCALE.

<br/>
<br/>

**Open Ended properties!**

- _RoundTrip_: `Decode (Encode (x)) == x`
- `DecodeLength(x) == Decode(x).length()`
- `EncodeAppend(vec,item) == Encode(vec.append(item))`
- ......

Notes:

- Potentially, we might play around with a few of these properties during a workshop this weekend.
