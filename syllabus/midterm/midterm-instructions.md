# Midterm Assignment for the Polkadot Blockchain Academy

This assignment is intended to assess whether the PBA learners have understood the core concepts in Modules 1, 2 and 3. Learners will take an existing white paper and dissect it to explain the core concepts underlying its logic, using the concepts learned in the first three modules. 

Students will work in groups of 3-4 to complete this project- there should be 12-16 groups. Each group will be assigned a whitepaper to analyse. 

## Project Prompt

Over the past weeks, we have covered many of the core technologies and concepts underscoring the power of Blockchain; concepts in economics, governance, cryptography. 

In this midterm project, you will work with a small group to reverse engineer a blockchain or blockchain project and evaluate how a real blockchain project addresses the following topics:

* Cryptography (Primitives, Digital Signatures, Hashing, Tries)
* Tokenomics (Market Economics, Token Utility, Token Allocation,Token Distribution)
* Governance (Collective Decision Making, Voting Systems)
* Blockchain Guarantees (Liveness, Censorship-resistance, Fairness)
* Blockchain Structure (Consensus Algorithm, State Machine)
* Blockchain Security (Threat Models)

You will also evaluate the project and explain what elements particularly work well and which you would like to improve. 

[This](./midterm-slide-template.md) is a template that you will use to evaluate the blockchain project.
