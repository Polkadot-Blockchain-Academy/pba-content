# 1. Cryptography

---

**Goal:** Evaluate the use of cryptography in this project; name at least two things you liked and two things you would want to improve.

* What are the main cryptographic primitives used in this blockchain project?
* Does this project use any exotic primitives?  If so, which ones?
* How does this project use digital signatures for security?
* How does this project use hashing and hash-based data structures to ensure security?

# 2. Economics

---

<widget-text style="padding: 0 3em 0 3em">

**Goal:** Evaluate the use of tokenomics in this project; name at least two things you like and two things you would want to improve.

* Does this project involve a native coin or currency? What are the tokenomics of the coin? How is the coin earned?
* How does this project use economic incentives to drive behavior?
* Use at least 3 of the following economic concepts in your answer:
    * Market Equilibrium (Supply and Demand): What is the supply schedule of the token, does it have inflation or deflation? Who will want to use the coin, and for what?
    * Economic Specialization
    * Game Theoretical Models
    * Auction Mechanics and Price Discovery Methods

# 3. Governance

---

<widget-text style="padding: 0 3em 0 3em">

**Goal:** Evaluate the use of governance in this project; name at least two things you like and two things you would want to improve.

* How does this project solve the collective decision making problem?
* What are the structures of governance in this project? How are changes proposed and voted on?
* What voting mechanisms are used in this project?
* Who is allowed to vote in this project? What are the voting criteria?

# 4. Blockchain Guarantees

---

<widget-text style="padding: 0 3em 0 3em">

**How does this blockchain/project guarantee the following?**

* **Liveness:** That the blockchain is always adding more transactions and that service will not be interrupted. 
* **Fairness:** No systemic discrimination that is against the rules of the protocol
* **Censorship-resistance:** No individual actor or coalition can prevent the access of another to the system.
* **Safety:** No conflicting information.

* What is the state transition function of this blockchain/project?
* What are the core elements of the application stack?
* What is the anatomy of a block in this system?
* What is the consensus algorithm that is used? How does it work?

# 7. Conclusion

---

<widget-text style="padding: 0 3em 0 3em">

Summarize your findings by connecting the most important ideas together and answering these questions: 

1. How do the cryptographic elements, the economic incentives and the blockchain parameters all contribute to the core goals of this blockchain?

2. Of the things that you identified you liked the _most_, what were the two top things you would highlight?

3. Of the things that you identified you liked the _least_, what were the two top things you would highlight?

4. Describe a way you would devise an attack on this system.

---

## Extra Credit/Stretch Goal

<widget-text style="padding: 0 3em 0 3em">

* Implement the attack described in the conclusion

* Propose an improvement to one or two aspects of your critique and implement it
