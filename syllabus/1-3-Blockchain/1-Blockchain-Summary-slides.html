## Five Aspects of Consensus

<pba-flex center>

- State machine validity
- Arbitrary / Political validity
- Authorship throttling
- Fork choice heuristic
- Finality

</pba-flex>

<aside class="notes"><p>The first two aspects are relatively simple and I&#39;ll discuss them briefly right now. The third and fourth are the main topic of this lecture. The fifth is covered in detail two lectures from now in great detail.</p>
<p>The first three aspects are about ruling possibilities out. The fourth and fifth are about deciding between any remaining possibilities.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## State Machine Validity

Some forks can be ruled out simply because they contain invalid state transitions.

![Invalid state transition](./img/invalid-state-transition.svg)

<aside class="notes"><p>Example spending more money than you have. Noting your present location such that you would have traveled faster than speed of light since last record. Calling a smart contract with invalid parameters.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Arbitrary / Political Validity

Similar to state machine validity.<br/>
Examples:

<pba-flex>

- Blocks that are too big
- Blocks that have "hack" transactions
- Empty blocks
- Block with Even state roots

</pba-flex>

![Invalid state transition](./img/politically-invalid-state-transition.svg)

<aside class="notes"><p>This concept is similar to the previous slide. In some sense this is even the same. This allows us to rule out some forks just for not having properties that we like. Or for having properties that we dislike.</p>
<p>Not everyone will agree on these properties ad that leads to long-term network splits.</p>
</aside></script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Authorship Throttling

Real-world blockchains impose additional restrictions on who can author blocks. Why?

![Unthrottled authoring leads to fork chaos](./img/fork-chaos.svg)

<aside class="notes"><p>These blockchains are supposed to be permissionless right? At least many of them are. Some are even very hardcore about that goal. So why would we want to restrict the authoring.</p>
<p>Answer: So the nodes are not overwhelmed. Unthrottled authoring leads to fork chaos. If anyone authored at any moment there would be blocks raining down left and right. It would be impossible to check them all. It would be DOS central. So we need some organization / order to the process.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Why Author at All?

- Altruism - You feel good about making the world a better place
- Your Transitions - Because you want to get your own transitions in
- Explicit incentives - Eg block reward

<aside class="notes"><p>If it costs energy to author blocks, why would anyone want to author to begin with?</p>
<p>Mining only when you want to get your transaction in seems like a good idea to me. People who don&#39;t want to self author, can pay other a fee to do it for them. This is the purpose of transaction fees. Most chains have transaction fees specified in the transactions themselves which go to the author</p>
<p>Some networks also add an explicit incentives such as a 50BTC reward per block.</p>

</pba-col>

[Cornell Lecture Slides](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6410/2018fa/slides/18-distributed-systems-byzantine-agreement.pdf)

<aside class="notes"><p>Several divisions of the Byzantine army are camped around an enemy city.
They plan to attack the city, but have not yet decided when to attack.
If the attack is coordinated, they will probably be successful, but if it is uncoordinated, they will probably be defeated.
What do our three properties mean in this scenario?</p>
<ul>
<li>Termination - every honest general will eventually decide when to attack</li>
<li>Agreement - honest general will all agree to attack at the same time</li>
<li>Integrity - the attack time will have been proposed by at least one honest general</li>
</ul>
<p>Leslie Lamport proposed this problem in the form of a story as a typical representative of the distributed consensus problem.</p>
<p>Since then we&#39;ve looked through so many layers of abstraction (contracts, smart contracts, state machines, dags) and so many technical implementation details (P2P networking, platform agnostic bytecodes, blockchain headers, merkle proofs).
We&#39;ve taken a huge class of problems - human coordination problems - and distilled them down to their absolute essence.
Human coordinate at global scale reduced to this one cute, carefully stated problem.</p>

<p>Finality can be proved to entities that are not involved in consensus.</p>
<p>We spoke about liveness previously in the authoring system. There it means that more blocks will be authored, more blockspace will be created and put up for sale.

<p>The basic idea is that anyone can lock up some tokens on chain (in the state machine). The participants with the most tokens staked are elected as the authorities. There is a state transition that allows reporting authority misbehavior (eg authoring competing blocks at the same height), and the authority loses their tokens. There are often block rewards too like PoW.</p>
