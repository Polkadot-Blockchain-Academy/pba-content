description: Architecture of the pallet-revive smart contract module
duration: 30min

# Architecture overview

// TODO diagram of the architecture

Notes:

- Diagram of a Substrate chain equipped with pallet-revive
- Go through the different components
  - Gas estimate through Substrate JSON-RPC
  - Tx submitted with a substrate-wallet
  - Node, and Runtime details

---

# ETH-RPC compatibility layer

// TODO diagram of the architecture with ETH-RPC

Notes:

There are two things we want to enable with this compatibility layer

- Make is easy for builder to port existing Dapp to Polkadot, and use battle tested ooling already developed by the EVM community.
- Make it easy for EVM to onboard, by supporting EVM wallets such as MetaMask.

To get there, we need to speak the language of Ethereum, both on chain by running a compatible VM, but also by implementing Ethereum JSON-RPC specs, as all interactions with the chains are done through the RPC.

# pallet-revive

Notes:

- pallet-revive is the runtime module, that handle smart contracts transactions, and manage the storage used by these contracts.

## pallet-revive Config

```rust
impl pallet_revive::Config for Runtime {
	type Time = Timestamp;
	type Currency = Balances;
	type RuntimeEvent = RuntimeEvent;
	type RuntimeCall = RuntimeCall;
	type CallFilter = Nothing;
	type DepositPerItem = DepositPerItem;
	type DepositPerByte = DepositPerByte;
	type WeightPrice = pallet_transaction_payment::Pallet<Self>;
	type WeightInfo = pallet_revive::weights::SubstrateWeight<Self>;
	type AddressMapper = pallet_revive::AccountId32Mapper<Self>;
	type RuntimeMemory = ConstU32<{ 128 * 1024 * 1024 }>;
	type PVFMemory = ConstU32<{ 512 * 1024 * 1024 }>;
	type UnsafeUnstableInterface = ConstBool<false>;
	type UploadOrigin = EnsureSigned<Self::AccountId>;
	type InstantiateOrigin = EnsureSigned<Self::AccountId>;
	type RuntimeHoldReason = RuntimeHoldReason;
	type CodeHashLockupDepositPercent = CodeHashLockupDepositPercent;
	type ChainId = ConstU64<420_420_420>;
	type NativeToEthRatio = ConstU32<1_000_000>; // 10^(18 - 12) Eth is 10^18, Native is 10^12.
	type EthGasEncoder = ();
	type FindAuthor = <Runtime as pallet_authorship::Config>::FindAuthor;
}
```

Notes:

We won't go in depth about the config in this lecture, as this is something that will be covered by the upcoming classes on Frame, but will look at a few interesting bits specific to pallet-revive

## Dispatch functions

```rust=
/// Makes a call to an account, optionally transferring some balance.
#[pallet::call_index(1)]
#[pallet::weight(T::WeightInfo::call().saturating_add(*gas_limit))]
pub fn call(
    origin: OriginFor<T>,
    dest: H160,
    #[pallet::compact] value: BalanceOf<T>,
    gas_limit: Weight,
    #[pallet::compact] storage_deposit_limit: BalanceOf<T>,
    data: Vec<u8>,
) -> DispatchResultWithPostInfo { /* ... */  }
```

| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `call`                         | Makes a call to an account, optionally transferring some balance.          |
| `instantiate`                  | Instantiates a contract from a previously deployed binary.                 |
| `instantiate_with_code`        | Instantiates a new contract from the supplied code.                        |
| `upload_code`                  | Uploads new code without instantiating a contract from it.                 |
| `remove_code`                  | Removes the code stored under a hash and refunds the deposit to its owner. |
| `map_account`                  | Registers the caller's account ID for use in contract interactions.        |
| `unmap_account`                | Unregisters the caller's account ID and frees the deposit.                 |
| `dispatch_as_fallback_account` | Dispatches a call with the origin set to the caller's fallback account.    |
