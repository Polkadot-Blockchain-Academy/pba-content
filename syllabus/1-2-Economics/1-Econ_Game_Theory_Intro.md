Notes:

- Cryptography would be meaningless without humans using it.
- Crypto & Econ pair well! Together they are the toolbox to design unstoppable systems.
- They have a great symphony: where cryptography's has boundaries, economics offers solutions and vice versa.
- Example from crypto module: Commit-reveal scheme is cryptographically secure. But how can we make sure entities reveal if it is to their disadvantage?

## Game Theory: What is a "Game"?

Abstract, Simplified model of ...

- Set of rational Actors ("Participants", "Players")
- Sets of Possible Actions taken by Players
- Preferences for outcomes

Notes:

- Abstract Modelling Pros & Cons:
  - simple, easy to analyze, can help understand, compare ,...
  - models vs reality: interactions outside of model, unexpected preferences

### Three firms want to hire an engineer...

<pba-cols>
<pba-col>

- The engineer brings added value to each firm of 300,000 USD per year.
- The payoff of the firm is known by everyone to be 300,000 USD minus the salary.
- The payoff to the engineer is salary minus cost of working, which is known to everyone.
- All firms make a salary offer at the same time.

</pba-col>
<pba-col>

### Quiz Questions:

1.  Is this game static or dynamic?
    What would need to change in the description of the game such that it would fall in the other category?
1.  Is this game of complete or incomplete information?
    What would need to change in the description of the game such that it would fall in the other category?

</pba-col>
</pba-cols>

Notes:

1.  The game is static.
    For it to be dynamic, firms would need to make offers sequentially, _knowing what the firms before had offered_.

2.  The game is of complete information.
    To make information incomplete, we would need to have that the value of hiring the engineer differs between firms and is unknown between firms.
    Or that the cost of working for the engineer is not known to the firms.
    The point is that we need to have uncertainty over payoffs.

- This lesson focuses on static games of complete information.
- When we look at auctions in lesson Price finding mechanisms, we will also consider games of incomplete information, both dynamic and static.

    <li class="fragment">Easy Case: <em>Dominant Strategies</em></li>
    <li class="fragment">"dominant": optimal no matter what the other players do</li>
</ul>

## Example: Prisoners Dilemma

Bonnie and Clyde are accused of robbing two banks:

<ul>
<li class="fragment">First Robbery: Overwhelming evidence, guaranteed conviction</li>
<li class="fragment">Second Robbery: Insufficient Evidence, conviction only if at least one of the two admits it.</li>
</ul>

---

## Example: Prisoners Dilemma

The Prosecutors offer a deal:

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Usually: 2 years for every proven bank robbery</li>
<li class="fragment">However: If you admit the second robbery and your partner doesn't ...</li>
<li class="fragment"> ... then you get 1 year and the partner gets 5 years</li>
<li class="fragment">If both admit it both get 4 years</li>
</ul>

Notes:

- They are interrogated in different rooms, apart from each other.

---

## Example: Prisoners Dilemma

Bonnie and Clyde have two options:

- $C$: **Cooperate** with each other and say nothing
- $D$: **Defect** and admit their crime

## Prisoners' Dilemma IRL

<ul>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Nuclear Arms Race:</strong> NATO and Russia prefer no arms race to an arms race. Yet, having some arms is preferable to having no arms, irrespective of whether the other one is armed.
</li>
<li class="fragment"><strong>OPEC:</strong> Limiting oil supply is in the best interest of all. However, given the high price that thus results, everyone has an incentive to increase individual oil supply to maximize profits.</li>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Tax Havens:</strong> All Nations want to have enough Tax Income, but ... </li>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Tragedy of the Commons:</strong> Pollution, Overfishing, etc</li>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Collaboration vs Freeriding:</strong> e.g. Deserting Soldiers</li>
</ul>

Notes:

OPEC: Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
It is something like a cartel that agree on limiting the global oil production and keep the oil price artificially high.

OPEC and Cartels generally seems to overcome the Prisoners' Dilemma...
More on that later.

## Analyzing Static Games

- Easy Case: Dominant Strategies
- Harder Case: What if there are no Dominant Strategies?

## Example: The Travelers' Dilemma

<div class="fragment">
<ul>
    <li> A group of travelers had an amazing trip to Switzerland. </li>
    <li> They wanted to share a piece of its culture with their friends and family. </li>
    <li> To do so, each traveler purchased a fondue set for CHF 50.- as a souvenir. </li>
</ul>

<br/>
<img rounded style="width: 300px; height: 300px;" src="./img/fondue_set.png" />
</div>

---

## The Travelers' Dilemma

<ul>
    <li class="fragment"> When landing back home, the travelers have discovered that the airline has lost all of the fondue sets. </li>
    <li class="fragment"> Fortunately, the airline is offering compensations ranging from CHF 2.- to CHF 100.-. </li>
    <li class="fragment"> Since none of the travelers has a receipt, the airline asks the travelers to independently declare the price of the lost fondue set (between 2 and 100). </li>
</ul>

---

## The Travelers' Dilemma

<ul>
    <li> If all travelers declare the same price $p$:
        <ul>
            <li> Then $p$ must be the truth.  </li>
            <li> Hence, each traveler receives $p$ CHF. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li style="margin-top:50px;" class="fragment"> Otherwise, if $p$ is the lowest price declared:
        <ul>
            <li> If a traveler has declared $p$, they receive $p + 2$ CHF. </li>
            <li> Otherwise, they receive $p - 2$ CHF.
        </ul> 
    </li>
    <li style="margin-top:50px;" class="fragment">  What would you declare? </li>
</ul>

## The Travelers' Dilemma: Discussion

<ul>
    <li> 
        Is declaring <i>a high value</i> a good strategy?
        <ul> <li class="fragment"> No: it is best to be the traveler who wrote the lowest price. </li> </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="fragment"> Is declaring <i>2</i> a good strategy? 
        <ul> <li class="fragment"> Yes. </li> </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">All travelers declaring a price of CHF 2.- is a <strong>Nash Equilibrium</strong></li>
</ul>

---

## Nash-Equilibrium

<ul>
<li class="fragment">A set of strategies (one for each player) is a NE if every players strategy is optimal given the strategies of all other players</li>
<li class="fragment">Equiv.: Nobody can gain anything from being the first to deviate</li>
<li class="fragment">Every dominant strategy equilibrium is also a NE</li>
</ul>

## Example: Coordination Game

<ul>
    <li>Alice and Bob want to have dinner together. Should they choose the French or the Indian restaurant?</li>
    <li class="fragment">Alice prefers French food, Bob prefers Indian food</li>
    <li class="fragment">... but if they choose different restaurants they will be alone and sad</li>

## Exercise: Nash Demand Game

<ul>
    <li class="fragment">Alice and Bob find a CHF 10.- note</li>
    <li class="fragment">Both can say how much of it they want to have</li>
    <li class="fragment">If the sum of their demands exceeds CHF 10.-, they get nothing</li>
    <li class="fragment">Otherwise, they receive as much as they demanded</li>
    <li class="fragment">Is there a Nash Equilibrium?</li>
</ul>

---

## Schelling Points

- Social Norm / Expectation which indicates a preferred equilibrium.

- Used for Coordination without Communication

- Examples:
    <ul>
        <li class="fragment">Nash Demand Game: Even Split</li>
        <li class="fragment">Restaurant Choice: Alternate, Coin Toss</li>
    </ul>

## Exercise: Voting Game

Switzerland is holding a vote on an Initiative. Assume that ...

<ul>
    <li class="fragment">75% of citizens oppose it, 25% support it</li>
    <li class="fragment">People are Lazy: If someones vote doesn't change the result, they'd rather not vote at all</li> 
</ul>

<p class="fragment">Questions:</p>
<ul>
    <li class="fragment">Are there Nash Equilibria? What are they?</li>
    <li class="fragment">Does a NE occur in reality? Why? / Why not?</li> 
</ul>

## Analyzing Static Games

<ul>
    <li class="fragment">Easy Case: Dominant Strategies (Prisoner's Dilemma)</li>
    <li class="fragment">Harder Case: Nash Equilibria, Schelling Points</li>
    <li class="fragment">Even Harder Case: What if there is no Nash Equilibrium?</li>
</ul>

---

## Example: Dollar Auction

Consider a sealed-bid, all-pay auction for a bank note worth CHF 100.

<ul>
    <li class="fragment">all-pay auction: you pay your bid even if you lose</li>
    <li class="fragment">Why is there no Nash Equilibrium?
        <ul>
            <li class="fragment">If nobody bids anything ... </li>
            <li class="fragment">If somebody bids and loses ...</li>
            <li class="fragment">If only one person bids anything ...</li>
        </ul>
</ul>

## Solution: Randomized Strategies

Two equivalent perspectives:

<ul> 
    <li class="fragment">Players are fixed and choose their actions at random</li>
    <li class="fragment">Players are drawn at random, but have fixed actions</li> 
</ul>

Notes:
explain with RPS

---

## Solution: Randomized Strategies

- Fact: Every Game is has a randomized NE ...
- ... If we assume that:
  - Players have finitely many options
  - Players want to maximize their _Expected Utility_

---

## Expected Utility

<ul>
    <li class="fragment">Expectation: Average, weighted by Probability</li>
    <li class="fragment">Utility: "happyness score" which each Player assigns to outcomes</li>
    <li class="fragment">Examples of Utility functions:
        <ul>
            <li class="fragment">Rock, Paper Scissors: U(Win) = +1, U(Draw) = 0, U(Lose) = -1</li>
            <li class="fragment">Prisoners Dilemma: U(N years jail time) = -N</li>
            <li class="fragment">Nash Demand Game: U(get X CHF) = X</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

## Game 1: Ultimatum Game

<ul>
    <li> The proposer decides how to split 100 points between themselves and the responder.</li>
    <li> The responder can either accept or reject the offer.</li>
    <li class="fragment">If the responder accepts, the points are split as proposed. If they reject, both receive 0 points.</li>
</ul>
---

## Game 1: Ultimatum game

- You are randomly matched with another student in the classroom.
- The interaction is anonymous.
- Player 1 gets an endowment of 100 points.
- Player 1 can offer Player 2 between 0 and 100 points.
- Player 2 sees the offer and can decide to accept or reject the offer.
- If the offer is accepted, the endowment is split according to the offer.
- If the offer is rejected, both get 0 points.
- There is no right or wrong here.
  It is your choice how to behave in this context!

## Game 1: Discussion

<ul> <li> What were your strategies here? </li>

 <li class="fragment">The proposer has the following considerations:
    <ul>
        <li class="fragment">What would the responder accept?</li>
        <li class="fragment">Answer: every payoff (larger than 0).</li>
        <li class="fragment">Therefore, I should offer, since I want to maximize my payout, something equal or slightly higher than 0.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">That means, the proposer offering something small and the responder always accepting is the only NE.</li>

## Game 2: Multi-Round Ultimatum Game

<ul>
    <li> We play the ultimatum game again, but this time over 5 rounds. </li>
    <li class="fragment"> In each round, the proposer may make an offer, and the responder may accept or reject. </li>

## Game 4: Discussion

<ul>
    <li class="fragment">Prof. Robert Axelrod held a tournament in the 1980s to find out which computer program ("strategy") would perform best against others.</li>
    <li class="fragment">In the first tournament, 14 strategies were submitted by leading Game Theorists and others in the field.</li>
    <li class="fragment">The game would be repeated 200 times.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Each strategy would play against every other strategy and against itself.</li>
</ul>

Notes:

## Game 4: Discussion

<ul>
    Some famous strategies were:
    <li class="fragment">Being sneaky: Cooperate but smuggle in some defections.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Grim trigger: Always cooperate but retaliate and defect forever, if the other defect once.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Tit-For-Tat: Start with cooperate and copy the opponent's strategy of the last round.</li>
</ul>

---

## Game 4: Discussion

<ul>
    <li class="fragment">Tit-for-Tat was the best-performing strategy.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Prof. Axelrod was able to deduce four main aspects of well-performing strategies:
        <ul>
            <li class="fragment">First: Be nice (do not defect first).</li>
