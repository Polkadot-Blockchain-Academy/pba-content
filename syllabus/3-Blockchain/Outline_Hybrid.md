# Hybrid Module Outline

Content might be arranged this way when the Blockchain module is being offered as a full-week collaboration with the Smart Contracts module.

## Monday

### Morning

- 📛 Introduce instructor, TAs - This module is coding heavy, we will spend a lot of time coding in class.
- 🗣️ Overview of Smart Contracts Lecture
- 🚧 TODO Some activity. Maybe something like Emre's unstoppable applications from Cambridge
- ☕ Break
- 🗣️ State Machine Lecture
- ⌨️ Begin BFS coding activity - specifically state machine part

### Afternoon
- 🗣️ Accounts vs UTXOs Lecture
- ⌨️ More BFS. try to get through chapter 1 before tomorrow
- ☕ Break
- 🗣️ Infrastructure Problems- Where do we actually run these contracts - actix example



## Tuesday

### Morning

- 🗣️ Blockchain Structure Lecture
- ☕ Break
- ⌨️ More BFS. Start the blockchain portion even if they are not done with the state machine stuff yet.

### Afternoon

- 🗣️ Consensus Part 1 Lecture - Authoring - Agreeing on Possibilities
- 🎲 Manual Consensus Activity (aka BitStory)
- ☕ Break
- 🗣️ P2P Networking Lecture
- ⌨️ Continue coding on BFS

## Wednesday

### Morning

- 🗣️ Consensus Part 2 Lecture - Finality - Agreeing on Ordering
- ☕ Break
- 🎲 [Grandpa Board Game Activity](https://github.com/Polkadot-Blockchain-Academy/pba-grandpa-board-game) <!-- markdown-link-check-disable-line -->
  - _Note that this repo is private, intended to be shared with the student cohort's github team for read access._
    _This also allows for people to pull up on mobile if logged in to view easier_
- ⌨️ BFS

### Afternoon

- 🗣️ Light Clients Bridges
- ⌨️ Continue Coding on BFS
- ☕ Break
- 🗣️ Resource Allocation lecture
- ⌨️ BFS

## Thursday

Big Contract Writing Extravaganza

### Morning

- 🗣️ EVM Concepts
- ⌨️ Solidity Code Along
- ⌨️ Vyper Code Along
- ☕ Break
- 🗣️ Wasm Concepts
- ⌨️ ink! Code Along
- ⌨️ ask! Code Along (optional)
- 🗣️ Introduce Contract Writing Workshop

### Afternoon

- ⌨️ Contract Writing Workshop

## Friday

This day combines the two culminating activities from the two modules into a day-long hands-on learning and comradery activity.

### Morning

Students will launch a blockchain a la the blockchain module.
Also get a few last short talks
Then they will use that chain to launch their smart contracts a la the contracts module.

- ⌨️ Start a Blockchain Activity
- 🗣️ Unstoppable Applications Lecture
- ☕ Break
- 🗣️ Types of Forks
- ⌨️ Forking Exercises

### Afternoon

🎲⌨️☕ In the afternoon we will use the chain that we launched in the morning to execute the smart contracts competition.
