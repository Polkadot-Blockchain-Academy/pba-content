# Standalone Module Outline

This is an example of how the content might be arranged when the module is being offered independently.
When possible, it is preferable to run this module as a collaboration with the smart contracts module.
For details, see the [Hybrid Lesson Outline](Outline_Hybrid.md)

## Day 1 - Morning Session

- 📛 Introduce instructor, TAs - This module is coding heavy, we will spend a lot of time coding in class.
- 🗣️ Overview of Blockchain Lecture
- ⌨️ Begin BFS coding activity - specifically state machine part
- ☕ Break
- 🗣️ Blockchain Structure Lecture
- ⌨️ Continue BFS coding activity. Students should start the blockchain portion and finish the first lesson in that part even if they are not done with the state machine stuff yet (which is very likely). Then they can continue whichever part moves them

## Day 1 - Afternoon Session

- 🗣️ Consensus Part 1 Lecture - Authoring - Agreeing on Possibilities
- 🎲 Manual Consensus Activity (aka BitStory)
- ☕ Break
- 🗣️ Accounts vs UTXOs Lecture
- ⌨️ Continue coding on BFS

## Day 2 - Morning Session

- 🗣️ P2P Networking Lecture
- ⌨️ BFS
- ☕ Break
- 🗣️ Consensus Part 2 Lecture - Finality - Agreeing on Ordering
- 🎲 [Grandpa Board Game Activity](https://github.com/Polkadot-Blockchain-Academy/pba-grandpa-board-game) <!-- markdown-link-check-disable-line -->
  - _Note that this repo is private, intended to be shared with the student cohort's gihub team for read access._
    _This also allows for people to pull up on mobile if logged in to view easier_

## Day 2 - Afternoon Session

- 🗣️ Light Clients Bridges
- ⌨️ Continue Coding on BFS
- ☕ Break
- 🗣️ Unstoppable Applications Lecture
- ⌨️ BFS

## Day 3 (Half Day)

The activity and lecture can bleed together. I imagine launching a chain and getting some basic tokens

- 🗣️ Resource Allocation lecture
- ⌨️ Start a Blockchain Activity
