## New Content Warning

<blokquote>Cambridgey (adj) - Overall good quality, but with rough edges or imperfections. Especially when related to PBA content.</blockquote>

Notes:

This is the third edition of the PBA.
That means a lot of our content is pretty polished and honed.
Whereas a year ago when we did this for the first time in Cambridge, a lot of stuff was, well, kinda Cambridgey.

But this smart contract content is actually brand new.
In the past we had a very short module at the end of the course specifically about writing ink! smart contracts.
This time we have moved it much earlier to emphasize the impact smart contracts can have on society, and why blockchains are so important for their success.
We also take a broader view, looking not only at ink!, but also at the EVM, Solidity, and Vyper.

We have put a lot of love into this content, and we hope you'll enjoy it and give us constructive criticism to make it less Cambridgey next time.
