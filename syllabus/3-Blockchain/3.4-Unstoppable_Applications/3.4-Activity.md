## Architect an unstoppable application

In this activity the students will work together or in groups to talk about existing structures in society(Google, Twitter, US Treasury, IMF, ICC) that require too much trust. 
Together as a class we will identigy these structures and make a list of those structures, and their functions(Google Maps for directions, using PayPal for subscriptions, using Twitter for news). 
Then either as a class, or in groups, using tools learned in the lecture
the students will start modeling an unstoppable application to create a trust-less version of one of those structures's functions. 
We will have time allocated to choose a single topic to work on and at the end, groups will present their ideas.

Type: Group activity, brainstorming, architecting unstoppable applications, decentralization philosphy

### Learning Objectives

1. Students should have proficiency in talking about unstoppable applications
2. Each student should be able to disect a societal structure (banking, governance, organizations) and talk about:
    a. Attack surface of existing structures
    b. An improved version using blockchain technology
    c. List the trade-offs
3. Students will be able to architect game-theoretic aspects of unstoppable applications

- Consensus mechanisms
- Cryptography
- Networks and social graphs
- Tokenomics and incentive schemes
- Light Clients

### Sessions

The activity will be delivered in 3 sessions

1. Brainstorming - all ideas welcome
    a. Brainstorm ideas as a class and create a list of ideas
    b. Class will vote on ideas, each student gets 1 or 2 votes
2. Group activity - whitepaper
    a. Class will get divided into n groups (n = top ideas)
    b. Create a draft proposal(document) for the idea using the tools above
3. Presentations - each group will present their ideas

---

### Outcomes

1. Architecture diagram
2. Document that includes:
    a. Problem statement
    b. Solution

### Notes

1. Students should be able to choose from multiple application styles
    a. Sovereign chains
    b. Parachains
    c. Smart Contract Dapps
    d. Multi-chain Dapps
