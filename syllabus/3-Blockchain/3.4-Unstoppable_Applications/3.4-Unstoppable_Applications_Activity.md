## Architect an unstoppable application

In this activity the students will work together or in groups to talk about existing structures in society (Google, Twitter, US Treasury, IMF, ICC) that require too much trust.
Together as a class we will identify these structures and make a list of those structures, and their functions (Google Maps for directions, using PayPal for subscriptions, using Twitter for news).
Then either as a class, or in groups, using tools learned in the lecture
the students will start modeling an unstoppable application to create a trust-less version of one of those structures' functions.
If time allows groups will present their ideas at the end.

Type: Group activity, brainstorming, architecting unstoppable applications, decentralization philosophy

### Learning Objectives

1. Students should have proficiency in talking about unstoppable applications
2. Each student should be able to dissect a societal structure (banking, governance, organizations) and talk about:
   a. Attack surface of existing structures
   b. An improved version using blockchain technology
   c. Design trade-offs
3. Students will be able to architect game-theoretic aspects of unstoppable applications

### Tools

- State machines
- Consensus mechanisms
- Cryptography
- Tokenomics and incentive schemes
- Light Clients

---

### Sessions

The activity will be delivered in 3 sessions

1. Brainstorming - all ideas welcome
   a. Brainstorm ideas as a class and create a list of ideas
   b. Class will vote on ideas, each student gets 1 or 2 votes
2. Group activity - whitepaper and architecture
   a. Class will get divided into groups
   b. Create a draft whitepaper (shared document) for the idea using the tools above
3. Presentations - each group will present their ideas

---

### Outcomes

1. Architecture diagram
2. Document that includes
   a. Problem statement
   b. Solution and reasoning for decisions about - Application stack (technology) - Tokenomics and incentives (game theory) - Consensus mechanism (feel free to get creative here, can be a made up one)

### Notes

1. Students should be able to choose from multiple application styles
   a. Sovereign chains
   b. Parachains
   c. Smart Contract Dapps
   d. Multi-chain Dapps
   e. Chain agnostic tools
