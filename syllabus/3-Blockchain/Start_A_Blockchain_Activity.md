# Start your own blockchain

In this activity, students will get hands on experience operating a blockchain node and seeing it interact with other blockchain nodes.
In particular, they will use the Substrate node template software.

## Learning objectives:

1.  How to run a node
1.  What the log messages mean
1.  Preview: How to configure a network with a chain spec
1.  Experience peer connections coming and going
1.  Practice checking for common not-peering issues (different genesis, firewall)

## Outline of Activity

### Compile

Because the compile time is long, this should be done in advance.
If there is a notion of "homework" in the class, this should be given as homework on the day before.
If not, we could get the compile going before the lecture begins.
We should also have a docker image ready to go.

### Generate User Keys

With Polkadot JS

### Get Tokens

Students request tokens from the teacher by sharing their address with the teachers in a public channel.
After the first five students have tokens, they pass them on to their peers.

### Optional Treasure Hunt

You could have tokens stored at eg the Alice key or other leaked keys and challenge students to find and recover the tokens.
Make up a story/myth about some mysterious figure who lost their key and left clues, etc.

### Run Nodes

Students start their own nodes and join the network

### Start Mining

Node runners can contribute PoW hashrate to the network in exchange for tokens.


### Fork the Network

In BA we forked the difficulty, but maybe there is something more compelling.

### Light Clients

TODO

### Other Infrastructure

Like block explorer or indexer?

### Smart Contracts

The Smart Contracts module has an activity about launching smart contracts on a running chain.
When these modules are run back-to-back, it makes an excellent learning experience to use this same chain we just launched to also launch the smart contracts.
