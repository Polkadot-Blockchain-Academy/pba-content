# Designing DAG-based consensus

---

## Goals of this lecture

<br/>

1. formalize the consensus problem and related concepts <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->
2. provide a framework for designing DAG-based consensus protocols <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->

---

## What is consensus?

<br/>

- a **process** of agreeing on the same result among a group of participants
- a fundamental **problem** in distributed computing
- a key **component** of blockchain technology stack

---

## Consensus features

<br/>

liveness, safety, integrity

---

## We have already seen some

<br/>

Nakamoto

Babe

Grandpa

Sassafras

Tendermint

...

---

## Who is running the protocol?

<br/>

Participants, called **nodes**

---

## Nodes

<br/>

- nodes can be either honest or malicious
- honest nodes follow the protocol
- malicious nodes can deviate from the protocol in any way they want
- malicious nodes can collude with each other
- malicious nodes can be controlled by an adversary

---

## Public key infrastructure

<br/>

- every node has its own <font color="#c2ff33">private</font> and <font color="#e6007a">public</font> key
- every node <font color="#c2ff33">signs</font> messages with its <font color="#c2ff33">private</font> key
- every node <font color="#e6007a">verifies</font> messages with other nodes' <font color="#e6007a">public</font> keys

---

## Public key infrastructure

<br/>

authenticated point-to-point communication

---

## Adversary

<br/>

Adversary **can** control the network delays, but is _computationally bounded_, i.e. it **cannot** break the cryptography (like forging the signatures).

---

## Network

<br/>

Communication via network... but what kind of network?

---

## Network models

<br/>

synchronous

partially synchronous

asynchronous

---

## Network models: synchronous

<br/>

> There exists a known upper bound \\(\Delta\\) on message delivery time.

<br/>
<br/>

_Intuition: there's a well-defined notion of a protocol round_

---

## Network models: asynchronous

<br/>

> There is no upper bound on message delay, though delivery is guaranteed.

<br/>
<br/>

_Intuition: you can't tell whether a node has crashed or has a long delay_

---

## Network models: asynchronous

<br/>

> There is no upper bound on message delay, though delivery is guaranteed.

<br/>
<br/>

- We assume that the adversary has full control over the message delays.
- The concept of a timeout is basically useless.

---

## Network models: partially synchronous

<br/>

> There exists a known bound \\(\Delta\\), and an unknown point in time **GST** after which the communication becomes synchronous with a delay \\(\Delta\\).

<br/>
<br/>

_Intuition: protocol will eventually work synchronously, but it needs to be safe before_

---

## Crucial theoretical results

<br/>

> [FLP theorem] It is impossible to have a deterministic protocol that solves consensus in an asynchronous system in which at least one process may fail by crashing.

<br/>
<br/>

> [Castro-Liskov theorem] It is impossible to have a protocol that solves consensus in a partially synchronous system with \\(3f+1\\) nodes in which more than \\(f\\) processes are byzantine.

---

---

## Consequence

<br/>

The best one can hope for in **asynchronous** scenario is **probabilistic** protocol tolerating **up to** \\(f\\) faults for \\(3f+1\\) participants.

<br/>

## Note on randomness

<br/>

Real probability is actually needed in the extremely hostile environment.
In case where the adversary is not legendarily vicious, even a dumb (but non-trivial) randomness source will do.

---

## Responsiveness

---

## Responsiveness

<br/>

Protocols that are **not responsive** have to **wait for** \\(\Delta\\) **time** to proceed to the next round.
<br/>

---

## Responsiveness

<br/>

Protocols that are **not responsive** have to **wait for** \\(\Delta\\) **time** to proceed to the next round.
<br/>
<br/>

- \\(\Delta\\) must be long enough to allow all honest nodes to send their messages.
- \\(\Delta\\) must be short enough to allow the protocol to make progress.
- In case of failure, they have to perform a pretty expensive recovery procedure (like the leader change).

---

## Responsiveness

<br/>

Protocols that are **responsive** **wait for** \\(2f+1\\) **messages** to proceed to the next round.

<br/>
<br/>

> <font color="#c2ff33">Why \\(2f+1\\)?</font>

<!-- .element: class="fragment"-->

---

## Responsiveness

<br/>

Protocols that are **responsive** **wait for** \\(2f+1\\) **messages** to proceed to the next round.

<br/>
<br/>

> <font color="#c2ff33">Among \\(2f+1\\) nodes, there are at least \\(f+1\\) honest ones, i.e. honest majority.</font>

---

## Responsiveness

<br/>

Protocols that are **responsive** **wait for** \\(2f+1\\) **messages** to proceed to the next round.
<br/>
<br/>

- Asynchronous protocols must be responsive.
- In good network conditions, they significantly much faster.

---

## Checkpoint

<br/>

Up to this point, we covered:

- consensus problem
- node types and adversary
- inter-node communication
- network models (synchronicity)
- protocol limitations in asynchronous network (honesty fraction and the need for randomness)
- responsiveness

---

## Warmup exercise: broadcast

<br/>

> (In an asynchronous network) **reliably** send a single message to all other nodes.

<br/>
<br/>

- (_validity_) If the sender is honest and broadcasts a message \\(m\\), then every honest node outputs \\(m\\).

<!-- .element: class="fragment"-->

- (_integrity_) If an honest node outputs a message \\(m\\), then it must have been broadcast by the sender.

<!-- .element: class="fragment"-->

- (_agreement_) If an honest node outputs a message \\(m\\), every other honest node outputs \\(m\\).

<!-- .element: class="fragment"-->

---

## Reliable broadcast protocol (RBC)

---

## Reliable broadcast in practice

<br/>

Due to the very high communication complexity we use heuristics or cryptography-based tricks.

---

## Fun fact

<br/>

Aleph paper, as the first, also achieved fully asynchronous randomness beacon:

- with efficient setup (\\(O(1)\\) rounds, \\(O(N^2)\\) communication)
- with \\(O(1)\\) expected rounds to output a random value with \\(O(N)\\) communication per round

## DAG-based protocols

## DAG

<br/>

Directed Acyclic Graph
<br/>

<img rounded style="width: 700px;" src="./img/3.10-dag.svg" />

---

## How does it relate to consensus?

<br/>

Intuition: graph represents the dependencies between messages (units).
<br/>

<img rounded style="width: 700px;" src="./img/3.10-message-dependency.svg" />

---

## Framework core

<br/>

1. We maintain a local DAG representing our knowledge of the units. <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->
2. We perform a local, offline consensus on our DAG. <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->

---

## Framework core

<br/>

1. We maintain a local DAG representing our knowledge of the units.
2. We perform a local, <font color="#c2ff33">**offline consensus**</font> on our DAG.

---

## Framework core (in other words)

<br/>

1. (online): sending and receiving units that contribute to the local DAG
2. (offline): everybody performs a local consensus on the DAG, just by looking at it

---

## Clue observations

<br/>

- local DAGs might differ... <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->
- but they are guaranteed to converge to the same DAG <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->
- the offline consensus is guaranteed to produce the same result <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->

---

## Adversary control

<br/>

<img rounded style="width: 600px;" src="./img/3.10-adversarial-control.svg" />

---

## Randomness? Where is randomness?

<br/>

It is put into the local consensus protocol.

---

## Relation to the atomic consensus problem

<br/>

- nodes receive transactions and put them into units
- nodes send each other their new units
- (locally) nodes come up with a linear ordering of the units and make blocks from chunks

---

## Digression: block production, information dissemination and finalization

<br/>

The common approach (e.g. in Substrate):

- production and dissemination is done in the same layer
- afterwards, nodes perform consensus on finalizing disseminated blocks

<br/>

Natural approach for DAG-based protocols:

- information dissemination happens as 'the first phase'
- block building and (instant) finalization happens locally

---

## Main consequences of the different separation

<br/>

- block signatures
- speed

---

## Local consensus: goal

<br/>

Local copies might differ significantly, blocks might have not come to all nodes yet, etc...
but we have to make common decision about unit ordering!

---

## Key concept: availability

<br/>

Intuitively, a unit is **available** if:

<br/>

- most of the nodes have it <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->
- it was distributed pretty promptly (we won't call a unit available, if it finally arrived everywhere after a month) <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->
- most of the nodes know that most of the nodes know that most of the nodes know... that it is available (mutual awareness) <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->

---

## Availability

<br/>

If a unit is available, it is a good candidate for being chosen as an 'anchor' in extending current ordering.

---

## Lightweight case study

<br/>

## Head

## Building blocks

---

## Choosing head

<br/>

<img rounded style="width: 500px;" src="./img/3.10-choosing-head.svg" />

---

## Availability determination

<br/>

Units vote for each other's availability.

---

## (Part of) availability determination

<br/>

Vote<sub><font color="#c2ff33">U</font></sub>(<font color="#e6007a">V</font>) =

- \[\[<font color="#c2ff33">U</font> is parent of <font color="#e6007a">V</font>\]\] if <font color="#e6007a">V</font> is from the round just after the round of <font color="#c2ff33">U</font>
- `0`/`1` if all children of <font color="#c2ff33">U</font> voted `0`/`1`
- `CommonVote(round(`<font color="#c2ff33">U</font>`), round(`<font color="#e6007a">V</font>`))` otherwise
  <br/>
  <br/>

_(U comes from the earlier round than V)_

---

## Bonus: generating randomness

<br/>

Sig<sub>`sk`</sub>(nonce)

<!-- .element: class="fragment"-->
<br/>

<div class="fragment">

- randomness must be unpredictable
- delayed reveal
- must depend on \\(f+1\\) nodes
- cannot be disturbed by the adversary

</div>
