## Learning Objectives

- Classify different consensus algorithms.
- Compare assumptions used in different algorithms.
- Deconstruct a given parachain's consensus into its various components.
- Articulate the tradeoffs of isolated vs. shared security.

Consensus Algorithms

- Bitcoin (Nakomoto consensus/PoW)
  - PoW = Proof of Waste!
  - Proof of Authority (PoA)
    - Byzantine Agreement
      - Trust specific authorities to make the decisions
      - We want authorities that have stake in the system
    - Who gets to participate - PoW says everyone (weighted by hash power) - Requires special equipment, which is expensive - PoA says some finite set of authorities make decisions
    - Proof of Stake (PoS)
      - Longest chain PoS
      - PoS is an overloaded term; it might better be described as "Proof of Tokens"
      - Common security model; it continues
    - _Point of Confusion_: BABE, Tendermint, GRANDPA could also known as 'consensus algorithms'; - Which people are involved, how we get them involved.
      (history in academia and how it's used in Blockchain)
    - Individual consensus mechanisms that have PoS in their name
    - NPoS:
      - Staking
      - Rewarding
      - Balance Retention
      - Underlying Block Production
      - Finality Gadget
      - Nakomoto Consensus
      - Derivative Consensus (Parachain). derivative of a relay chain's finality system
  - State machine
