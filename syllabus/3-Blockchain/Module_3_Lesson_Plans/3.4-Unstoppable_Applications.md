# Lesson 4: Unstoppable Applications

## Why is this important

A blockchain is just one layer of an application stack. Like cryptography where attackers will go after the weakest link, blockchain attackers will also find the weakest point in the stack. Web3 developers need to understand the application stack they are working within and how to design a foundation for unstoppable applications.
