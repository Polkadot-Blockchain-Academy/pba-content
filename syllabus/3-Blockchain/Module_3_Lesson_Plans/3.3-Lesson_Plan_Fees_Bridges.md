# Lesson 3: Fees, Bridging, and Ordering

## Why is this topic Important?

Almost all blockchains have fees and are single-threaded (thus demanding a linear execution order). Likewise, multiple blockchains exist that may interact with each other over bridges. All of these come with security implications and tradeoffs.

## Core Ideas to Convey

-

## Learning Outcome

After this lecture, students should be able to evaluate extrinsic ordering strategies and how to interpret messages from other consensus systems.

## Learning Objectives

- Explain how extrinsics are ordered within a block
- Describe fee-based and fee-less prioritization methods
- Explain the risks and assumptions when interacting with external consensus systems

## Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills

- Knowledge of block authorship and structure (what goes into a block)
- Concept of separate consensus systems

## Activities and Exercises
