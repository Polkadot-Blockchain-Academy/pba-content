# Lesson 1: Blockhain Overview

## Why is This Topic Important?

Many blockchains are presented based on their use case, e.g. Bitcoin as money or Ethereum as a smart contract platform. Participants will need a mental model of blockchain as a state machine to understand parachains.

This module should set students up for effective deep dives on BABE, GRANDPA, Staking, light clients, and Polkadot/parachain architecture.

## Core Ideas to Convey

- State machine basics
  - Simple state machines and redundancy
  - Fault tolerance in distributed systems
  - How distributed state machines advance
- Framework of Blockchain

  - What does a blockchain provide? What is a blockchain solving?
  - Neat overview of what problem blockchains solve?
  - Cryptography Don't have to trust the conduit to haev a reasonable expectation of privacy or of the origin of a message.
  - Blockchain provides a service: don't need to trust a party to have guarantees.
  - What is the service? What are the guarantees
  - Service
    - Shared computational resource
    - State machine
    - Many different parties who don't trust each other can interact
    - Logic is executed correctly
    - After some point, there is a very real expectation that it will not revert that state transition (append-only?)
    - Regardless of who you are, you have access to this machine- open access
  - Without intermediaries
    - Permissionless
    - Decentralized
    - Credible expectations of privacy and authenticity

- What are the nature of the solutions to these needs? - Anatomy of a Blockchain - Cryptographic Linked List (AKA Chained Blocks) - Each block has info coming in from external environment - Packets of information with zero or more signatures attached: we call these "Transactions" - **Axis 1:** Consensus Algorithms (How to 1) add blocks and 2) decide whether a block has been irrevertibly added?) - Consensus algorithm - 1 and 2 are combined in some algos and not in others - **Axis 2:** State Transition Funcion - Bitcoin: Spent output means that the output can no longer be spent again - Ethereum and Polkadot: State at the beginning of the block, at the end there is a deterministic alteration to a new state. - Polkadot:
  How do we come to a consensus about what a chain actually is? What are our 'service' guarantees - Whatever the accepted rules are for participation, they will be respected by the system. - Service will not be interrupted. - Respect the business logic - No systemic discrimination against the rules of the protocol - There could be rules that are necessary to provide the elements of service - Censorship-resistant - Two aspects of the service: - Liveness- always adding more transactions - When will a transaction be 'locked in' (and never reverted) - Bunch of participants in this multi-agent system who must determine what happens - Agreement on what's already been decided: Shared history - Two people will never have conflicting information and disagree. One might have MORE information, but the other will never believe that a different scenario is true. - Bitcoin - Smart Contract - Namecoin
- How does it actually work- trust without intermediaries?

**Substrate was created to solve the problem of every blockchain being isolated from one another**

- Open, distributed state machines
  - How to select participants
  - How to advance state
  - How to agree on conflicting state
- Security
  - Breaking consensus
  - Various forms of punishment
  - Security dilution
- Polkadot
  - NPoS
  - Aura, BABE, SASSAFRASS
  - GRANDPA
  - Slashing
- Parachains
  - Block authorship
  - Finality

## Learning Outcome

By the end of this lesson, learners will be able to architect a consensus system with isolated processes and articulate the tradeoffs they made.

## Learning Objectives

- Classify different consensus algorithms.
- Compare assumptions used in different algorithms.
- Deconstruct a given parachain's consensus into its various components.
- Articulate the tradeoffs of isolated vs. shared security.

## Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills

- Hash functions
- Digital signatures
- Cryptographic linked lists
- Basic economics

## Activities and Exercises

These activities can be done in the language of the student's choice:

- Write a blockchain that advances. It does not need an interface (e.g. to submit transactions), but it should maintain some state (e.g. a timestamp) and should produce new blocks (they can be empty, but the headers would of course be unique).
- Write a fork choice rule.
