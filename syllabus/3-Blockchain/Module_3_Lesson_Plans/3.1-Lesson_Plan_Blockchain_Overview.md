# Lesson 1: Blockhain Overview

## Why is This Topic Important?

Many blockchains are presented based on their use case, e.g. Bitcoin as money or Ethereum as a smart contract platform. Participants will need a more general understanding of blockchains.

This module should set students up for effective deep dives on BABE, GRANDPA, Staking, light clients, and Polkadot/parachain architecture.

## Core Ideas to Convey

- Expectations
  - What problem is being solved?
  - Cryptography provides strong guarantees about _information_ without a trusted party, regardless of the conduit over which the information was transported.
  - But not strong guarantees about _behavior_.
  - We want a system with similarly strong guarantees about behavior.
- Global applications
  - People use these services with no guarantees about the logic or information they are interacting with.
  - Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc.
  - Journalism, sources
  - Banks
  - Lawyers, notaries, apostilles, regulators
- Trustless provision of digital services
  - Anyone should have access (permissionless)
  - Credible expectations of privacy and authenticity
  - Credible expectations that a state transition is final
  - Logic should be executed correctly
  - No one party (or coordinated group) should be able to stop the system from advancing or behaving as intended (unstoppable).
  - The system should behave as expected _even if_ the operators of the system are not.
- Organization
  - Somewhat ironically, the ability for _users_ to organize sans trust comes from the assumption that the operators of the system are _unable_ (or unwilling based on incentives) to organize.
- Tiptoed around it: It's a state machine
  - State machines have a global state,
  - And a state transition function (STF)
- Trust
  - What is trust? => In this context, blind faith
- Examples
  - Maybe get the class involved here to talk about how we trust things.
  - Two users on Twitter:
    - Trust that we are seeing information from the same database
    - Trust that if a tweet is from X, then X wrote that tweet
    - Trust that others see our messages as from us
    - Trust that the messages we see are the messages the users wrote
    - Trust that we're interacting with the same algorithm that chooses what to show from the database (highly unlikely)
- Application Architecture
  - Removing trust allows us to unpackage applications. We tend to think of an app as a complete package.
  - But when users have credible guarantees that they are interacting with the same data and logic, many applications can be built on the same system.
- Have we even said blockchain yet?
- No
- Good
- Blockchain dimensions
  - Axis 1: Consensus
    - Liveness
    - Safety
  - Axis 2: State Machine
    - What are the rules
- State Machines
  - Data structure (UTXO set, general trie)
  - STF: How do items in the trie change?
- Anatomy
  - State
  - Blocks
- Blocks
  - Header: Hash pointer, block height, digests
  - Body: Array of packets of information from the outside world with zero or more signatures attached
- Polkadot
  - In Polkadot/Substrate, the STF is actually part of the state itself!
- Consensus
  - Whole next lecture dedicated to this, so we are staying strictly conceptual here.
  - Probably good to ask the class to give their ideas of consensus here.
- Liveness
  - How do we ensure that state transitions happen?
  - Someone needs to propose a batch of transitions (a.k.a. block) and new state.
  - Lots of economic incentives
  - For various reasons, people may have some incentive to propose blocks (to guarantee liveness of their own application, for profit)
- Safety
  - Lots of state machines exist that don't record all states. Why keep the history?
  - How to give a guarantee that once a change is committed it will never be reverted?
- View
  - Two people will never have conflicting information and disagree. One might have MORE information, but the other will never believe that a different scenario is true.
- Security
  - What backs these liveness and safety guarantees?
  - Centralized system: trust
  - Decentralized system: proof of authority (acquired in some way: wasting energy, being elected based on stake in the system)
- Bad actors
  - Users should not be able to abuse the system (deny its guarantees to others).
    - Relies on secure design (key choice, hash choice, pub API, etc.) and economic design (make it expensive to mis-use).
  - Operators should not be able to effect invalid state transitions or prevent them from taking place at all.
    - Also relies on technical design (transactional vs. autonomous) and economic design (make it hurt).
- Polkadot
  - If one state machine is useful, probably people will want more
  - Our trust in the _system_ (not any party) is based on its security. How strongly does it uphold its guarantees.
  - But security can be diluted!
  - Polkadot isolates a lot of these systems to provide an environment with strong, non-diluted guarantees that supports many (unique) state machines.
  - Substrate was created to build them.

## Learning Outcome

By the end of this lesson, learners will be able to design a toy state machine and describe a state transition function.

## Learning Objectives

- Learn the motivations for making a blockchain
- Consider a blockchain's role in an application stack
- Describe a blockchain in terms of consensus and STF
- Describe some guarantees that Polkadot provides

## Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills

- Hash functions
- Digital signatures
- Cryptographic linked lists
- Basic economics

## Activities and Exercises

**Personal Trust Inventory** - List areas in your own life where you rely on trusted intermediaries. Think about everything from work, home, romance, sustaining food and shelter, catching up with your mom, etc.

**Design a state machine** - Design a simple state machine that represents a simple app. Consider how you would represent the state of the app, and what the state transition function is (what are users allowed to do?). For example, consider chess. How would you represent the state of the board, whose turn it is? For the state transition function how would you express a "move"? Is it possible to express an _invalid_ move?

**Manual Blockchain** - In this group exercise, students manually create a blockchain that tracks students grades throughout an imaginary course. Consider a small number of students (like 3) to make this practical. Each block represents an assignment in the class. The body of the block represents a grade for each student. The header has a parent hash, a number, and a body_root. Discussion topic: A common problem that teachers face is students coming at the end of the semester and handing in late work hoping it will still be graded and counted, or asking for re-grades on old assignments. Would that be possible with this gradeing scheme? What would other students think about regrades?

**Code Some State Machines** - This coding example is the first in the [Blockchain From Scratch](https://github.com/JoshOrndorff/blockchain-from-scratch) tutorial. We will work through this tutorial throughout module three.
To begin with we will code up some state machines. That repository guides you through a few simple and slightly more complex examples. After that you can code any state machine you like using the same interface.
Consider coding some of the ideas you brainstormed in the first activity
