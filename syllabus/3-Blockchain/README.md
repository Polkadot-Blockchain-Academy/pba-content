# Blockchain Fundamentals Module

This module introduces students to the shortcomings of centralized infrastructure including censorship, equity, reliability, and trustworthiness. It then demonstrates through lectures, coding activities, and games, how a peer to peer network can achieve consensus on a shared history that is recorded in the blockchain data structure.

The module is designed to fit a schedule of 5 session of contact time lasting about 3-4 hours each. Some out-of-class study is expected, and a graded assignment is recommended.

## Hands on Activities

- The primary coding activity is [Blockchain From Scratch](https://github.com/JoshOrndorff/blockchain-from-scratch/). Each student should close this repository to work through it in and after class. This will occupy 8-10 hours of class time.

- Grandpa Board Game - TODO find the repo, it may have gotten deleted. For now the content was copied into https://polkadot-blockchain-academy.github.io/pba-book/blockchain-contracts/_materials/grandpa-board-game.html

- Start a Block and Fork Off - This activity is written up [in this repo](./Start_A_Blockchain_Activity.md) and also in [its own repo](https://github.com/Polkadot-Blockchain-Academy/Academy-PoW). TODO Unify these in the separate repo so the activity can be re-used externally.
