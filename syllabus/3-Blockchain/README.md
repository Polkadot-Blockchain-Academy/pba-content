# Blockchain Fundamentals Module

<!--TODO update based on https://github.com/Polkadot-Blockchain-Academy/pba-content/pull/360 moving forward-->

This module introduces students to the problem space that blockchain is trying to solve (resilient, equitable, trustless infrastructure) as well as the technical aspects of how it solves those problems and to what extent it falls short.

The primary coding activity, which will run throughout the module is [Blockchain From Scratch](https://github.com/JoshOrndorff/blockchain-from-scratch/).

The module is taught over 2.5 days

## Lessons Overview

### Day 1 - Morning Session

- Intro - Introduce instructor, TAs - This module is coding heavy, we will spend a lot of time coding in class.

- Overview of Blockchain Lecture

- Begin BFS coding activity - specifically state machine part

- Blockchain Structure Lecture

- Continue BFS coding activity. Students should start the blockchain portion and finish the first lesson in that part even if they are not done with the state machine stuff yet (which is very likely). Then they can continue whichever part moves them

### Day 1 - Afternoon Session

- Consensus Part 1 Lecture - Authoring - Agreeing on Possibilities

- Manual Consensus Activity (aka BitStory)

- P2P Networking Lecture

- Continue coding on BFS

### Day 2 - Morning Session

- Consensus Part 2 Lecture - Finality - Agreeing on Ordering

- Grandpa Board Game Activity

- Accounts vs UTXOs Lecture

- Continue Coding on BFS

### Day 2 - Afternoon Session

- Resource Allocation lecture

- BFS

- Light Clients Bridges

- BFS

### Day 3 (Half Day)

- Unstoppable Applications Lecture

- Launch a blockchain activity
