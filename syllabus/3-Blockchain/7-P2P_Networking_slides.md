        Total Information Awareness (TIA): In the early 2000s, DARPA initiated the TIA program aimed at developing technologies for mass surveillance and data analysis. The project raised concerns about privacy and civil liberties, eventually leading to its cancellation in 2003 due to public outcry.

# Historical P2P applications

Notes:
    Napster, Limewire

<section>
    <h2>Napster</h2>
    <ul>
        <li class="fragment">Launched in 1999, popular P2P platform</li>
        <li class="fragment">Central server for indexing, P2P for transfers</li>
        <li class="fragment">Shutdown in 2001 due to legal issues</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
        Napster's story is closely tied with the band Metallica. In 2000, Metallica discovered that a demo of their song "I Disappear" was being circulated via Napster before its official release. This led to Metallica filing a lawsuit against Napster for copyright infringement. Napster had to comply by banning hundreds of thousands of users from their platform who were sharing Metallica's music. This was a turning point in digital copyright law and played a significant role in Napster's eventual shutdown in 2001.

Notes:

Talk about how when a partition happens in P2P vs Centralized
In p2p only one node needs to have a full copy in order for the file to
be able to be distributed across the network

        <li class="fragment">No privileged nodes</li>
        <li class="fragment">Less bottlenecks with bandwidth</li>
        <li class="fragment">DOS resistant</li>

    <aside class="notes">
        <ol>
            <li>No single node or nodes (CDN) have access to all of the content or files or is critical for operating the network. Each node has a copy of the data.</li>
            <li>No central node carrying all of the load of traffic. Block production and Block peering/importing can be mentioned here.</li>
            <li>Difficult to overload the network or DOS (Not a single node is privileged).</li>
            <li>Although many nodes are run on Centralized cloud compute platforms, they don't have to be (Typically).</li>

    <h2>Difficulties or Disadvantages</h2>
    <ul>

    <aside class="notes">
        <ol>
            <li>Latency may be an issue if we need to wait for many peers to receive the data produced from a single node since everyone may not have a direct connection. Mention finality time!</li>
            <li>No central point to go and snoop all users data (for better or for worse).</li>
            <li>Why we have hardware requirements for blockchain networks.</li>

## Applications

Notes:
    1. What are some of the types of applications that lend themselves to this kind of network topology? Can anyone think of any?
    2. File sharing(Music)?
    3. Messaging and communication? 
---

## Initial Discovery

- Bootnode/bootnodes (More on this later in Substrate)

Notes:

1.) Must know someone who is participating in the network initially(Bootnode)

---

## Attacks

Notes:
Can anyone think of a way to exploit some of these networks?
What would be some things to try to take advantage of?

<section>
    <h2>Attacks</h2>
    <img style="width: 600px" src="img/eclipse_attack_1.svg"/>

Notes:

1. Distorts view of the healthy normal honest state of the network
1. Transaction confirmations can be fictions
