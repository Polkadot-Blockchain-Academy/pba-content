//! Until now we have focused primarily on the blockchain as a datastructure. We've created instances of the

//! At this point much of the logic from before will be reusable, but it will be attached to the client
//! as methods on the client instead of on the block or the header. The block and header will be treated
//! mainly as data
//
// Exercise for later: Client does a hard fork at a particular block height. The fork logic is to change runtimes.
