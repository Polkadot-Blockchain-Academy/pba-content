# Introduction to Substrate

> Additional notes for lecturer, to be handed out to students after the lecture.

* Read more about why we use Rust at Parity: https://www.parity.io/blog/why-rust

* Rust safety: https://stanford-cs242.github.io/f18/lectures/05-1-rust-memory-safety.html
* https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/5y3cxb/how_many_security_exploits_would_rust_prevent/


* Lin Clark's awesome talk on WASI (not super relevant to our work though): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh9WXPu0hw8 / https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HktWin_LPf4

* The substrate clients should still have some level of *determinism in their performance*. If
  authority nodes have extremely varied performances, they could start finalizing different forks.

* There have been attempts at writing FRAME alternatives, namely assemblyscript.

* Think about the differences between a runtime and a smart contract.

* Substrate Primitives (`sp-*`), Frame (`frame-*`) and the pallets (`pallets-*`), binaries (`/bin`)
and all other utilities are licensed under [Apache

Substrate Client (`/client/*` / `sc-*`) is licensed under [GPL

  - Apache2 allows teams full freedom over what and how they release, and giving licensing clarity to
    commercial teams.

  - GPL3 ensures any deeper improvements made to Substrate's core logic (e.g. Substrate's internal
    consensus, crypto or database code) to be contributed back so everyone can benefit.
