# Lesson 6: Advanced XCM Use Cases

### Why is this topic Important?

This topic is important because it introduces and explores HRMP transactions between Turing Staging and Mangata. HRMP messaging plays a crucial role in cross-chain communication, enabling the transfer of assets and executing actions between different parachains in the Polkadot ecosystem. Understanding and practicing HRMP transactions allows developers to leverage the power of Polkadot's interoperability and build complex cross-chain applications.

### Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills

To fully engage with the activities outlined in this material, it is recommended to have the following prerequisite knowledge or skills:

- Familiarity with extrinsics of Substrate blockchains.
- Understanding of HRMP message and usage.
- Knowledge of Substrate-based DEX and liquidity pools.

### Learning Outcome

By completing the activities described in this material, learners can expect to achieve the following learning outcomes:

1. Practical experience in performing HRMP transactions between Turing Staging and Mangata.
2. Familiarity with depositing assets into a liquidity pool and receiving LP tokens.
3. Understanding the construction and execution of XCM messages.
4. Ability to set up automated tasks triggered by compound_rewards.
5. Proficiency in debugging XCM messages using xcm-tools.

These outcomes will equip learners with the necessary knowledge and skills to work with HRMP transactions, contribute to cross-chain development efforts, and build versatile applications within the Polkadot ecosystem.

### Activities

- Top up parachain wallets
- Mint liquidity on a Substrate-based DEX
- Construct an HRMP message to remotely call compound extrinsic
- Leverage Turingâ€™s task to set up auto-compound
- Debug XCM message to practice trouble-shooting
