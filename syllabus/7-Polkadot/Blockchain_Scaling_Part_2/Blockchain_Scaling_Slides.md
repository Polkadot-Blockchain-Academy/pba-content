# Blockchain Scaling 2:
# Modular and Heterogeneous

---

## Modularity: decoupling roles of an L1

- Sequencing: ordering operations as input to STF
  - Necessary, but always off-chain
- Ordering state transitions
  - Definition of a blockchain
  - In the case of L2s: commitments to state transitions (usually state roots) of other chains stored on L1 chain
- Executing state transitions
  - By definition L2s move execution off-chain
- Data Availability
  - Decoupling DA from ordering is often referred to as "modular blockchains" (Celestia)

---

## Taxonomy of L2s

Notes:
https://l2beat.com/scaling/summary

---

## Taxonomy of L2s

- Sidechains
  - Inherit ordering from L1
  - Honest majority bridge (e.g. 5-of-8 multisig)
  
---

## Taxonomy of L2s

- Smart Contract Rollups
  - Inherit ordering and availability from L1
  - "Trust-minimized" bridge:
	- STF correctness with validity or fraud proofs
	- Inbox: option for transactions proposed through base layer to avoid sequencer/proposer censorship

---

## Taxonomy of L2s

- Validiums
  - Inherit ordering from L1
  - Trust-minimized bridge
  - Off-chain DA

---

## Taxonomy of L2s

- Sovereign Rollups
  - Inherit ordering and availability from L1 (even Bitcoin lol)
  - No trust-minimized bridge: correctness and censorship-resistance entirely off-chain

## Settlement?

- Many in the Ethereum community define rollups by their bridges
  - Makes sense if the purpose is scaling ETH transactions
- Rollup nodes can fork the rollup and point at different bridge
  - L1 native tokens remain locked
  - L2 native tokens retain value
- Some modular consensus layers don't allow settlement: Polkadot and Celestia

---

## Data Availability

---

## Data Availability

- _Not_ data storage. Only for a limited time.
- Two purposes:
  - Security: to verify STF correctness in optimistic systems (one week in ORUs, ~30s in Polkadot)
  - Liveness: for sequencers to download in order to build on top of. Must be a bit longer than STF correctness (~1 day in Polkadot, 30 days in danksharding)
- Cannot use fraud proofs (fisherman's dilemma)
- Simplest option is to post on L1 (Ethereum calldata)

---

## Data Availability Committee (DAC)

- Nodes each redundantly hold data
- Can be off-chain or using committees of L1 validators
- Post threshold signature to L1 attesting to availability
- Coordination can be expensive for rollup users: which shard has my data?

---

## Data Availability Sampling (DAS)

- Data is erasure encoded
- Light clients can verify availability by randomly sampling nodes
- e.g. Celestia (standalone DA layer), Danksharding (Ethereum roadmap), Polygon Avail (built on Substrate), ZKPorter, Eigenlayer

https://github.com/availproject/data-availability/blob/master/reference%20document/Data%20Availability%20-%20Reference%20Document.pdf

---

## How to ensure coding was done correctly?

- SNARKs: too expensive
- Fraud proofs: requires 2D encoding to be efficient
- KZG commitments: also allows distributed reconstruction (chunking)

---

## 2D Reed Solomon

<img src="../../../assets/img/7-Polkadot/Blockchain_Scaling/2dReedSolomon.png" width="20%" />

- Computes Merkle roots for rows and columns
- Requires storing 2$\sqrt{n}$ state roots instead of one
- Allows O($\sqrt{n}$) fraud proofs of encoding

---

## DA in Celestia

- Full nodes each redundantly hold erasure coded data off-chain
- Light clients sample 50% and participate in consensus
- Possible incentive problem: easier to scale data than execution so standalone DA layers can more easily be undercut

Notes:
https://docs.celestia.org/concepts/how-celestia-works/data-availability-layer/

---

## DA in Danksharding

- 2D erasure coded using KZG polynomial commitments
  - Also provide proof of encoding
  - KZG requires trusted setup, ceremony done earlier this year
- Distributed construction: no nodes need build all rows and columns
- Distributed reconstruction: 
  - Chunking and sharding similar to Polkadot
  - Higher threshold due to 2D encoding
- Allows light client consensus through sampling
- Data removed after 30 days

## Rollup Security

## Validity Proofs for Scaling

- Recursive proofs for constant space blockchains (Mina)
- zk-rollups
  - Transactional (private or public): e.g. Aztec
  - Application-specific: e.g. STARKDex, Loopring
  - Smart contract: e.g. ZEXE (Aleo), zkEVM (Polygon, ZKSync, Scroll)

## Optimistic Rollups: Fraud Proofs

“Don’t go to court to cash a check — just go if the check bounces.”

- Proposers post a state root to L1 with deposit
- Challengers can submit fraud proofs within period (typically 7 days)
  - If successful, rewarded portion of deposit
- Fraud proofs can be interactive (Arbitrum) or noninteractive (Optimism)

## Rollup Training Wheels

- Stage 0
  - On-chain DA
  - Must have inbox
  - No STF correctness
- Stage 1
  - STF correctness (fraud or validity proof)
  - 6-of-8 multisig can override SC security
  - SC upgrades with either same multisig threshold or same delay as challenge period
- Stage 2
  - Security override only in case of bugs (discrepancy between two prover implementations)
  - Upgrades must have delay greater than 30 days

## Rollup Sequencers

- Currently centralized (unlike Polkadot collators)
- Shared sequencing: e.g. Espresso, OP Superchain
- Proposer-builder separation

## Optimistic Rollups: Permissionless?

- Spam state roots stall the chain
   - Arbitrum allows multiple to be posted (fork and prune) similar to Nakamoto consensus
- Spam challenges can delay confirmation
   - They typically must be executed separately and sequentially to prevent collusion
   - Arbitrum BOLD allows challenges to be executed together, bounds time at 7 days
- Spam necessitates permissioned proposer/verifier sets

---

## Optimistic Rollups: Verifier’s Dilemma

- Challenge reward isn't enough to incentivize verifying all state roots
  - Proposers don't face gambler's ruin on L1
  - Verifiers aren't rewarded for executing valid state transitions
- Attention challenges

---

## Rollup Security Assumptions

- ORUs are only as secure as their verifiers
  - Typically centralized or small permissioned set
  - Don't have similar incentives to L1 validation
  - Reputational damage argument
- Bridging is slow
  - LPs can provide exit liquidity for small transactions...
  - ...but then a small number of whales are checking all rollups

---

## How Does Polkadot Compare to Other Rollup Protocols?

<img src="../../../assets/img/7-Polkadot/Blockchain_Scaling/polkadotrollup.png"  width="40%" />

- Approval checking is a decentralized shared watchtower network
- The value proposition of Polkadot is making consistent security assumptions across the modular stack
