# UNGRADED Week 5 Assignment - Cross Consensus Messaging (XCM)

Due to the proximity to the end of the course, this assignment will be ungraded or graded only based on effort.

Upgrade the code of several of the parachains launched during the week 4 assignment to support XCM. Do the on-chain runtime upgrades, open the XCM channels, and execute the XCM messages.
