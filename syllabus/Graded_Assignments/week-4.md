# Week 4 Assignment - Polkadot and Smart Contracts

Major TODO here. This is currently just a braindump. Open to major revision.

This week's assignment is a problem set where you must do each of these activities.

# Exercise 1 - Launch a Parachain

Could be one big project where they take their runtime from last week's assignment, port it to a parachain, and register it on a local rococo-like network.

Upgrade the code to support XCM. Do the on-chain runtime upgrades, open the XCM channels, and execute the XCM messages.
