# Week 4 Assignment - Polkadot and Smart Contracts

Major TODO here. This is currently just a braindump. Open to major revision.

This week's assignment is a problem set where you must do each of these activities.

# Exercise 1 - Launch a Parachain

Could be one big project where they take their runtime from last week's assignment, port it to a parachain, and register it on a local rococo-like network.

# Exercise 2 - EVM Smart Contract

Write an EVM smart contract. Deploy it somewhere we provide?

# Exercise 3 - Ink! Smart contract

Write an ink! smart contract. Deploy it somewhere we provide?

# Exercise 4 - Write a precompile or chain extension

Is this a feasible exercise?
