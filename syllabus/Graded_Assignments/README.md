# Graded Projects

In order to assess student understanding and provide hands-on learning experience, we assign roughly one graded assignment per week throughout the course.

The exact assignment schedule will vary by cohort depending on content order, where the weekends fall, and instructors' preferences.
Some cohorts may include a pre-course assignment or a final assignment as well.
Some cohorts may choose to omit an assignment on a particular week.

## Assignment Style

Some assignments will be more like problem sets where students must complete each of several small exercises. Others will be like larger projects where students must choose one larger assignment and complete only that one.

## Grading

Currently each assignment is graded in its own bespoke way.
We are moving toward a more unified system where as much grading is automated as possible.
If you are creating a new assignment or grading one for the first time, checkout https://github.com/Polkadot-Blockchain-Academy/ucb-qualifier-grading/ as a tool that may help you in your endeavors.

## Menus of Assignments

This section contains links to individual assignments that may be useful throughout the course.

Typically an assignment covers content from more than one module.
Therefore some assignments may only be useful when content is taught in a particular order.

This list links to all graded assignments used in the PBA, roughly in order of where they will appear in the course.
