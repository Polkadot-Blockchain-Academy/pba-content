Graded Projects
===============

In order to assess student understanding and provide more hands on experience, we will assign four graded assignments throughout the course.

Assignment Style
----------------

Some assignments will be more like problem sets where students must complete each of several small exercises. Others will be like larger projects where students must choose one larger assignment and complete only that one.

Timing
------

There will be one assignment for each week of the course. The assignment will be given on the Thursday of the corresponding week and cover all the material covered that week (including Friday which will not yet have been seen at the time the assignment is given). It will be due by midnight the following Monday.
