## Pedagogy

<widget-text center>

Biggest feedback from wave 1:

Too much boring lecture

</widget-text >

Notes:

You are all very smart and have many interesting things to teach our students. But nobody can maintain focus for three straight hours. Nor do they want to. Nor do they deserve to be subjected to that.

---v

### Common Fallacy: Lecture comes first

> I want to do more hands-on stuff... but the time is short and I **have** to lecture first....

### This is _WRONG_!

<!-- .element: class="fragment"-->

**_Lecture for 50% of time maximum_**!

<!-- .element: class="fragment"-->

Notes:

Even if you decide that you absolutely must do a long lecture, you aren't going to get the value you think.

---v

### Teachers Imagine

<img src="./img/hand.png" style="width: 900px; border-radius: 20px;">

Notes:

Teachers imagine eery student is like this one guy. But look at most of them.

---v

### But Really

### But Really

---v

### What to do Instead

- **Code-along** - students write the same code you do
- Treat them as **apprentices**
- Consider assigning pre-reading or _short_ pre-recorded lectures
  - To dive deeper, explore the [flipped classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom)

Notes:

It's okay to treat students as apprentices. Let them learn through their work. It's okay to assign them a task that they don't yet know how to do. This will get them to ask you how and they will be motivated to hear and understand the answer.
In the old day, the long long ago, it was expensive to duplicate books and impossible to distribute video. In that setting a teacher explaining a concept live really added value. Today we have the internet and it is trivial to distribute text or video resources. In this setting the teacher's biggest value is interacting with students, answering questions, guiding their work, giving feedback.

---v

### When you must lecture for > 30min

<widget-text center>

### Break it up

</widget-text>

- Coffee Break
- Kahoot Game
- Physical Exercise (_yes, seriously_)

Notes:

I'm skeptical that it's ever necessary to lecture continuously this long, but some of us are new to teaching, and I'm not going to be an anti-lecture extremist.
Exercise: Students will do it if you tell them to. I've gotten theaters of 50+ adults to do pushups together. It honestly helps a lot. Gets the blood flowing, stimulates conversation and laughing, encourages class bonding. The key is to make sure everyone feels comfortable and welcome. Not everyone can do perfect pushups. It's okay to do them on your knees or against the wall or do situps or squats instead. Consider setting a cumulative goal for the class and add up everyone's contribution.

# Content Brainstorming

<br>

**Coding exercises, module by module**

<widget-text center>

...in-class activities<br>
...after-class assignments

</widget-text>

<br><br>

There are no stupid ideas!<br>
Keep 'em coming, write them down! üòÅ

Notes:

Everyone is welcome to contribute ideas for any module
We can also brainstorm along the lines of what content to teach, but I'm trying to focus on non-lecture stuff so people start thinking in that direction.
Flip through the repository instead of showing this slide

## Guest Lessons

> Guest lessons are 60-90 min one-off lessons (could be Q and A, live coding, hands-on activity, or even just a lecture) where the guest covers any topic that they find interesting and relevant. They are not expected to advance our curriculum directly.

- Suggest topics
- Suggest Speakers
- Volunteer
- We especially need these early in the course

---

## Instructor Action Items

1. Inventory & review of your content.

- Note **in an issue** the outstanding items to be updated/added/removed
- More code content needed throughout all modules!

2. **Get an outline of what work needs to be done for content ASAP to Dan&Joshy and your TAs**

- Kickoff meeting with your TAs to outline work
- Put your TAs to some tasks _now_ so we can get moving!

Everyone should have access to this repo, let Dan know if not.

**_üìù New issue by instructors on inventory to kick things off ‚è∞_**

Note:

Dan will push you before sub0 to do this!
