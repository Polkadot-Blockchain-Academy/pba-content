## Dates and Commitment

* Review exact dates for each module
* Make some Formal Commitments

Notes:
This is the part where I'm asking each of you to make a formal commitment in front of each other. Don't take this lightly.

---v

### Module 1 - Cryptography

* Instructor: (Hopefully) Isaac DeFrain
* TAs: Dan, Giulia, Hector
* Dates: January 10 - 11

Can you commit?

Notes:
We are still struggling to get an offer to Isaac. I've done everything I can to make this happen. Can the TAs commit?

### Module 2 - Economics

* Instructors: Samuel
* TAs: Jonas, Florian, Alfonso
* Dates: January 12 - 13

## Pedagogy

<center>
Biggest feedback from wave 1:

Too much boring lecture
</center>

Notes:
You are all very smart and have many interesting things to teach our students. But nobody can maintain focus for three straight hours. Nor do they want to. Nor do they deserve to be subjected to that.

---v

### Common Fallacy: Lecture comes first

I want to do more hands-on stuff, but the time is short and I have to lecture first.

TODO Dan, How do I make this text appear after another key press?

This is WRONG!

Lecture for 50% of time maximum!

Notes:
Even if you decide that you absolutely must do a long lecture, you aren't going to get the value you think.

---v

### Teachers Imagine

Notes:
Teachers imagine eery student is like this one guy. But look at most of them.

### But Really

### What to do Instead

* Code-along - students write the same code you do
* Treat them as apprentices
* Consider assigning pre-reading or _short_ pre-recorded lectures
  * To dive deeper, explore the [flipped classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom)

Notes:
It's okay to treat students as apprentices. Let them learn through their work. It's okay to assign them a task that they don't yet know how to do. This will get them to ask you how and they will be motivated to hear and understand the answer.
In the old day, the long long ago, it was expensive to duplicate books and impossible to distribute video. In that setting a teacher explaining a concept live really added value. Today we have the internet and it is trivial to distribute text or video resources. In this setting the teacher's biggest value is interacting with students, answering questions, guiding their work, giving feedback.

---v

### When you must lecture for > 30min

<center>Break it up</center>

* Coffee Break
* Kahoot Game
* Physical Exercise (Seriously)

Notes:
I'm skeptical that it's ever necessary to lecture continuously this long, but some of us are new to teaching, and I'm not going to be an anti-lecture extremist.
Exercise: Students will do it if you tell them to. I've gotten theaters of 50+ adults to do pushups together. It honestly helps a lot. Gets the blood flowing, stimulates conversation and laughing, encourages class bonding. The key is to make sure everyone feels comfortable and welcome. Not everyone can do perfect pushups. It's okay to do them on your knees or against the wall or do situps or squats instead. Consider setting a cumulative goal for the class and add up everyone's contribution.

---

## Content Brainstorming

Let's brainstorm some coding activities module by module.

Could be used for in-class activities or as assignments.

Right now we are brainstorming, so there are no stupid ideas.

Notes:
Everyone is welcome to contribute ideas for any module
We can also brainstorm along the lines of what content to teach, but I'm trying to focus on non-lecture stuff so people start thinking in that direction.
Flip through the repository instead of showing this slide

## Guest Lessons

> Guest lessons are 60-90 min one-off lessons (could be Q and A, live coding, hands-on activity, or even just a lecture) where the guest covers any topic that they find interesting and relevant. They are not expected to advance our curriculum directly.


* Suggest topics
* Suggest Speakers
* Volunteer
* We especially need these early in the course
