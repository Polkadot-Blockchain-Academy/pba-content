# Nominated Proof of Stake

## _in Polkadot_

## Why Proof of Stake Ser?

Why do we use PoS?

<div>

- Tokens locked + prone to being slashed.
- Economic Security ðŸ’¸ðŸ¤‘.

</div>

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- Everything else (finality, parachains, etc.) is built on top of this base layer of economic security.

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---v

### Why Proof of Stake Ser?

- Remember that Polkadot is at the end of the day a validator-set-as-a-service.
- Secure Blockspace, the main product of Polkadot is provided by these validators.

## What is NPoS: Assumptions

Assumptions:

- **Validators**: those who intend to author blocks. i.e. _Validator candidate_.

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- **Nominators/Delegators**: Those who intend to support wanna-be authors.

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- Validation and nomination intentions can change, therefore we need **periodic elections** to
  always choose the **active/winner validators/delegators** + hold them slashable.

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- Every election period is called an **_Era_**, e.g. 24hrs in Polkadot.

### What is NPoS: Re-inventing the Wheel

**Solo-POS**

<image src="../../../assets/img/4-substrate/dev-6-x-npos-0.svg" style="width: 1000px">

---v

### What is NPoS: Re-inventing the Wheel

- Authority-wanna-bees aka. validators bring their own stake. No further participation. Top validators are elected.

- Problems?

Notes:

Low amount of stake that we can capture, impossible for those who don't want to run the hardware to join.

---v

**Single-Delegation-POS**

<image src="../../../assets/img/4-substrate/dev-6-x-npos-1.svg" style="width: 1000px">

---v

### What is NPoS: Re-inventing the Wheel

- Anyone can dilute themselves in any given validators. Top validator based on total stake are
  elected.
- Voters are called **delegators**.

- Problems?

Notes:

- Better, but funds might be delegated to non-winners, which get wasted.
- In other words, there is no incentive to delegate to those that are non-winners.

---v

**Multi-Delegation-POS**

<image src="../../../assets/img/4-substrate/dev-6-x-npos-2.svg" style="width: 1000px">

---v

### What is NPoS: Re-inventing the Wheel

Your stake is divided $\frac{1}{N}$ (or arbitrarily) among $N$ validators.

Problems?

Notes:

Same issue as before.

### What is NPoS: Re-inventing the Wheel

- You name up to `N` nominees, an _algorithm_, computed either onchain or offchain, decides
  the **winners** and **how to distribute the stake among them**.
- Voters are called **Nominators**.

---v

### What is NPoS: Re-inventing the Wheel

- âœ… As a nominator, you are free to express your desire to back non-winners as well. Once enough people have expressed the same desire, the non-winner will become a winner.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- âœ… Has a much higher chance to make sure staked tokens won't get wasted.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- âœ… Can optimize other criteria other than "who had more approval votes".

## NPoS Drawbacks

- We decided to solve an np-hard, multi-winner, approval based, election problem onchain ðŸ¤ .

<pba-flex center>

- scalability. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- scalability. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- scalability. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- scalability. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- and scalability. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

</widget-text>

- But we (strive to) get much better economic security measures in return ðŸŒˆ.

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- Long term, this can in itself be solved by what Polkadot provides best, more Blockspace ðŸŽ‰!

### NPoS Protocol Overview

- The current NPoS protocol revolves around an **election round**, which is itself made up of 4
  episodes.
- This gives you an idea about how we solved the scalability issue for the time being.

---v

### NPoS Protocol Overview: Episode 1

**Snapshot**

- Enables multi-block election.
- Allows us to not need to "freeze" the staking system.
- Allows us to index stakers, not `AccountIds`.

---v

### NPoS Protocol Overview: Episode 2

**Signed Submissions**

- Any signed account can come up with a **NPoS solution** based on that snapshot.
- Deposits, rewards, slash, other game-theoretic tools incorporated to make to secure.

---v

### NPoS Protocol Overview: Episode 3

**Validator Submissions as Fallback**

- As the first backup, any validator can also submit a solution as a part of their block authoring.

---v

### NPoS Protocol Overview: Episode 4

**Fallbacks**

- If all of the above fails, the chain won't rotate validators and the governance can either:
  - dictate the next validator set.
  - trigger an onchain election (limited in what it can do).

## This was recently [used in Kusama](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/kusama-era-4543-slashing/1410) ðŸ¦œ.

## NPoS Objective

- Given the powerful tool of NPoS, what should we aim for?
- Let's first recap:

1. Polkadot validators are the source of truth for the state transition of both the relay chain and all of the parachains + bridges.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
2. Polkadot validator are assigned to parachains as backing group, and swapped over time.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
3. Polkadot validators all author the same number of blocks, i.e. they are of same importance.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

Point 2 is not to imply that the polkadot validator set's security is partitioned among parachains,
security comes from approval voters.

### NPoS Objective: Election Score

```rust
pub struct ElectionScore {
  /// The minimal winner, in terms of total backing stake.
  ///
  /// This parameter should be maximized.
  pub minimal_stake: u128,
  /// The sum of the total backing of all winners.
  ///
  /// This parameter should maximized
  pub sum_stake: u128,
  /// The sum squared of the total backing of all winners, aka. the variance.
  ///
  /// Ths parameter should be minimized.
  pub sum_stake_squared: u128,
}
```

---v

### NPoS Objective: Election Score

- NPoS allows us to incentivize the formation of a validator set that optimized the aforementioned `ElectionScore`.

- This score is ALWAYS calculate and checked onchain. This is why we can accept solutions from the outer world.

Notes:

A common example: we allow signed submissions. What if they send solutions that are censoring a particular validator? if it can achieve a better score, so be it! we don't care.

---v

### NPoS Objective: Election Score

- The default algorithm used in both the onchain/offchain solvers is the [Phragmen
  algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phragmen%27s_voting_rules).
- Proved to provide high fairness and justified representation properties whilst being verifiable in
  linear time.
