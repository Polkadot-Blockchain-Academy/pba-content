# Build Simple Parachain

We're going to build a simple parachain without Cumulus!

---

## Parachain requirements

A parachain needs two things:

- A WASM runtime with `validate_block` function exposed
- Node side that can sync relay chain blocks and talk to the relay chain

Notes:

Talking to the relay chain means speaking the networking protocol of
Polkadot to distribute the PoV.
