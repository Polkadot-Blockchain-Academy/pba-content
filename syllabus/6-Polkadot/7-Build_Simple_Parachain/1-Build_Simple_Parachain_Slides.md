# Agenda for Today

- Build a simple collator without Cumulus
- Introduction to Cumulus and how to build a Parachain
- Workshop: Manually registering a parachain
- Workshop: How to acquire a parachain slot

---

## Before we begin:

```sh
# We will need a polkadot binary, e.g.
git clone https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/
cd polkadot
cargo build --release

# Compile this in advance to save time:
git clone https://github.com/Polkadot-Blockchain-Academy/cumuless-parachain-PBA-BA-2023
cd cumuless-parachain-PBA-BA-2023
# Ma a branch *for yourself*
git checkout -b <YOUR GITHUB USERNAME HERE>
cargo build --release
```

## Build Simple Parachain

We're going to build a simple parachain without Cumulus!

<pba-flex center>

- PVF
- Collator

<pba-flex>

Notes:

This will be a parachain built without using FRAME.
There will be only one collator and no collator selection logic.
No message processing.
No transactions.
No runtime upgrades.
No parachain full nodes.

---

## Parachain requirements

A parachain needs two things:

<pba-flex center>

1. A WASM runtime with `validate_block` function exposed
1. Node side that can sync relay chain blocks and talk to the relay chain

<pba-flex>

Notes:

Talking to the relay chain means speaking the networking protocol of Polkadot to distribute the PoV.

---

## Minimal parachain runtime (PVF)

```rust
#![no_std]
#![cfg_attr(
	not(feature = "std"),
	feature(core_intrinsics, lang_items, core_panic_info, alloc_error_handler)
)]

// Make the WASM binary available.
#[cfg(feature = "std")]
include!(concat!(env!("OUT_DIR"), "/wasm_binary.rs"));

#[cfg(feature = "std")]
/// Wasm binary unwrapped. If built with `BUILD_DUMMY_WASM_BINARY`, the function panics.
pub fn wasm_binary_unwrap() -> &'static [u8] {
	WASM_BINARY.expect(
		"Development wasm binary is not available. Testing is only \
						supported with the flag disabled.",
	)
}

#[cfg(not(feature = "std"))]
#[panic_handler]
#[no_mangle]
pub fn panic(_info: &core::panic::PanicInfo) -> ! {
	core::intrinsics::abort()
}

#[cfg(not(feature = "std"))]
#[alloc_error_handler]
#[no_mangle]
pub fn oom(_: core::alloc::Layout) -> ! {
	core::intrinsics::abort();
}

#[cfg(not(feature = "std"))]
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn validate_block(_params: *const u8, _len: usize) -> u64 {
	loop {}
}
```

Notes:

The panic and oom handlers are Rust-specific things you don't need to worry about.
If we actually include an infinite loop into the `validate_block` function, a parablock will never be backed/included by the relay chain validators.

---

## Parachain node side

<pba-flex center>

- Our node will sync relay chain blocks
- When importing the new best block,<br>we'll connect to the backing group
- Then we'll advertise our block ("collation")<br>to a validator in the group
- The validator will request the collation<br>from us using `collator-protocol`
- Now it's in the hands of validators<br>to include our block

<pba-flex>

Notes:

Validators are shuffled into small backing groups, which rotate
regularly with `group_rotation_frequency`.
Currently, collators can only produce the next block after their previous
block has been included by the relay chain (remember `CandidateIncluded`).
Since inclusion happens in the next block after candidate being backed,
this means collators can only produce blocks every 12s. Async backing
will change that.

---

## Collator-protocol

Polkadot contains the implementation of the both collator and validator
side of the collator protocol.

```rust
/// What side of the collator protocol is being engaged
pub enum ProtocolSide {
	/// Validators operate on the relay chain.
	Validator {
		/// The keystore holding validator keys.
		keystore: SyncCryptoStorePtr,
		/// An eviction policy for inactive peers or validators.
		eviction_policy: CollatorEvictionPolicy,
	},
	/// Collators operate on a parachain.
	Collator(
		PeerId,
		CollatorPair,
		IncomingRequestReceiver<request_v1::CollationFetchingRequest>,
	),
}
```

Notes:

We're going to use Polkadot as a library configured for the collator side.

## Time to look into the code

Our PBA parachain is a trimmed down version of:

## Exercise

Make the state of the Parachain a fixed sized 2d field (e.g. 25x25) that evolves at each block according to Game of Life and print the state at each block.
