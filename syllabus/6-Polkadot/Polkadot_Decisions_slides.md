# The Decisions of Polkadot

---

## Creating an “Invention Machine”

Jeff Bezos outlined in an annual letter to Amazon shareholders how he approaches decision making, by categorizing decisions as either Type 1 or Type 2 decisions.

## Type 1 Decisions

> Some decisions are consequential and irreversible or nearly irreversible – <span style="color:#d92f78">**one-way doors**</span> – and these decisions must be made methodically, carefully, slowly, with great deliberation and consultation. If you walk through and don't like what you see on the other side, you can't get back to where you were before. We can call these Type 1 decisions.

---

## Type 2 Decisions

> But most decisions aren't like that – they are changeable, reversible – <span style="color:#d92f78">**they're two-way doors**</span>. If you've made a suboptimal Type 2 decision, you don't have to live with the consequences for that long. You can reopen the door and go back through. Type 2 decisions can and should be made quickly by high judgment individuals or small groups.

## In the context of blockchains...

### Type 1 Decisions

Decisions that cannot easily be changed in the future.

- Must be a part of the original protocol design.
- Changes might as well be considered a new protocol.

### Type 2 Decisions

Decisions that can be easily changed in the future.

- Can be included into the protocol at a later time.
- Changes can be considered as part of the evolution of the protocol.

## A Format for Discussing Decisions

- What is (the decision)?
- What do we need to consider when making (the decision)?
	- Is it a Type 1 or Type 2 decision?
- What decisions has (chain) decided to take and why?
	- What tradeoffs have they chosen?
- What decisions have others decided to take?
	- How might those decisions be better or worse?
- Where does the blockchain community still have to improve on (the decision)?
