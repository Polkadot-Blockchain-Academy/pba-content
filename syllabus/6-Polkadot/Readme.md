Assumptions: 

- Content time per day: 3 hr mornings, 3.5-4 hr afternoons
- Default 1 hr estimate for talks, including questions
- Assumes we find the right break points to split exercises into 30-45 minute blocks. The later exercises may in practice be much longer than forecasted.
- Assumes that Joshy is handling the presentation of exercises, though these will likely be split up more evenly. I’m certainly willing to help.
