Assumptions: 

- Max instruction window 9:00-6:00 (Lunch from 1:00-1:45)
- Assumes Rob is willing to present all four lectures he gave in Buenos Aires and that he is generally available from the 2nd to the 4th
- Assumes Rob's lectures will be same duration as in BA recordings
- Assumes Shawn's "Shared Security and Blockspace" lecture can be replaced by Rob's "Execution Sharding" and "Blockspace" lectures
- Assumes Rob's "Execution Sharding in Polkadot" lecture doesn't overlap too much with Joshy's "Introduction to the Parachains Protocol". Or we're happy to cover this twice at different depths.
- Assumes that Rob's lighter 45 m coverage of XCMP can replace Shawn's planned 1.5 hour XCMP lecture

Lesson Plan Goals:
- Satisfy lesson dependencies (EX: "Deep Dive: Execution Cores" must come after "Introduction to the Parachains Protocol")
- Place exercise time between lectures wherever possible for student engagement
- Don't schedule any two lectures back to back from the same presenter unless requested
