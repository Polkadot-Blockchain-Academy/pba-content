## Data Availability Problem

How do we ensure a piece of data is retrievable without storing it on every single node forever?

Incorrectness can be proven (fraud proofs), but unavailability can't.

---v

### Data Availability Problem: Parachains

Imagine a parachain collator produces a block, but only sends it to relay chain validators to verify. 

What could such a collator do?

<pba-flex center>

- Prevent nodes and users from learning the parachain state
- Prevent other collators from being able to create blocks

</pba-flex>

We want other collators to be able to reconstruct the block from the relay chain.

---v

### Data Availability Problem: Relaychain

If that block's PoV is only stored by a few validators, what if they go offline or rogue?

<pba-flex center>

- Honest approval-checkers are not able to verify validity

</pba-flex>

Notes:

This is really bad. It means we could finalize an invalid parachain block.

---

## Erasure coding

The goal:

<pba-flex center>

- Encode data of K chunks into a larger encoded data of N chunks
- Any K-subset of N chunks can be used to recover the data

</pba-flex>

### In code

```rust

type Data = Vec<u8>;

pub struct Chunk {
	pub index: usize,
	pub bytes: Vec<u8>,
}

pub fn encode(_input: &Data) -> Vec<Chunk> {
	todo!()
}

pub fn reconstruct(_chunks: impl Iterator<Item = Chunk>) -> Result<Data, Error> {
	todo!()
}
```

### Polynomial we need

<img style="width: 800px" src="../../../assets/img/5-Polkadot/Data_Availability/reed-solomon.png" alt="reed-solomon">

We want to have a polynomial, such that:

$$ p(x_i) = y_i$$

Notes:

Question: what is x_i and y_i wrt to our data?

---

### Lagrange interpolating polynomial

$$ \ell_j(x) = \frac{(x-x_0)}{(x_j-x_0)} \cdots \frac{(x-x_{j-1})}{(x_j-x_{j - 1})} \frac{(x-x_{j+1})}{(x_j-x_{j+1})} \cdots \frac{(x-x_k)}{(x_j-x_k)} $$

$$ L(x) = \sum_{j=0}^{k} y_j \ell_j(x) $$

---

### Reed-Solomon codes

Congrats! You've just learned Reed-Solomon encoding (almost).

Actual Reed-Solomon codes are defined over finite-fields.

It can detect and correct combinations of errors and erasures.

Notes:

The simplest example of a finite field is arithmetic mod prime number.
Computers are quite bad at division by prime numbers.
Reed-Solomon codes are used in CDs, DVDs, QR codes and RAID 6.

## Polkadot's Data Availability Protocol

- Each PoV is divided into n_validators chunks
- Validator with index i gets a chunk with the same index
- Validators sign statements when they receive their chunk
- Once we have 2/3 + 1 of signed statements, PoV is considered available
- Any subset of 1/3 + 1 of chunks can recover the data

Notes:

The total amount of data stored by all validators is PoV * 3.
With 5MB PoV and 1k validators, each validator only stores 15KB per PoV.
With this protocol, we've killed two birds with one stone!

### Challenge 1

How does a validator know if a chunk corresponds to the committed data?

---v

### Not that Merkle!

---

### Challenge 2

How do we know if what can be reconstructed from chunks is the same data that was encoded with Reed-Solomon?

- Polkadot uses approval-voting/disputes mechanism for that
- Celestia uses Fraud Proofs
- Danksharding uses KZG commitments

---

## Data Availability Sampling

https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09044

Ethereum (Danksharding) and Celestia adopt an approach of Data Availability Sampling, where each light client makes its own judgement of availability by sampling and distributing a few random chunks.

This can eliminate honest majority assumption!

This approach guarantees there's at least one honest full nodes that has the data with high probability.

---

## Safety of Polkadot's protocol

If we have at most f out of 3f + 1 malicious + offline validators, then if the data is marked as available, it **can** be recovered.

What if that assumption is broken?

If 2f + 1 are malicious, every PoS is doomed anyway.

Notes:

We'll see in the next lecture, how approval-voting can prevent unavailable blocks from being finalized even with >f malicious nodes.

---

## 2d Reed-Solomon Encoding

<img style="width: 800px" src="../../../assets/img/5-Polkadot/Data_Availability/2d-reed-solomon.png" alt="2d-reed-solomon">

Notes:

The approach of 2d Reed-Solomon Encoding can reduce the size of
a Fraud Proof used by Celestia. But it adds an overhead computationally and on the amount of data stored.

---

## Comparison with other approaches

- Both Danksharding and Celestia use 2d encoding and DAS
- Celestia doesn't implement data sharding
- Data availability is only part of ensuring validity
- Polkadot's DA is able to process dozens of MB per second

Notes:

Danksharding is aiming at 1.3 MB/s and Celestia < 1 MB/s.

---

## Ideas to explore

- Data Availability Sampling for parachain light clients and full nodes
- Consider using KZG commitments
- Reducing the number of signatures to verify
- A Data Availability Parachain

## Questions?

---

### Bonus

- Polkadot uses a field of size 2Ë†16 with efficient arithmetic
- Polkadot uses an FFT-based Reed-Solomon algorithm (no Lagrange)
