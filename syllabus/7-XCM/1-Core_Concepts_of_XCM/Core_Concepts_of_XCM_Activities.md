## Activities

- Make XCM that does some logic, given the account balance you have on a single parachain to execute a few increasingly more complex routes to things.
- XCM message that is overly complex. Have student identify and rewrite with less program steps & routes
- XCM that is HERE only, and thus should be a local extrinsic instead, have them discover this and outline the right calls.
- Open channels manually on a testnet, configure correctly.
- Issue XCM on a testnet

- Multiple instructions given in XCM that throws error.
  - Fix errors and configuration change
  - Works on one chain, but not another. How to fix to work for both?

ONLY use XCM simulator - not a full testnet / zombie net. Maybe polkadot-launch.

- look at proposed but not finalized addition (something like a ZK instruction set)

- Distribute post cards to everyone, and do XCM stuff with it e.g. fill out a preformatted form on the post card
  - (Assuming lecture hall seats are numbered/labelled) Ask students to write the `MultiLocation` of their target, and ask the TAs to send them to their intended target.

## Exercises

- Exercise to make a multilocation correctly based on where you are and where you want to go
- given starting state and instructions, what is the state after execution?
- If you are given error, describe what it means and how do you correct it?
