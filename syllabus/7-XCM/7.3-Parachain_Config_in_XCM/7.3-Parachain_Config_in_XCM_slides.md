### Outline

<!--
You can reference slides within this presentation like [this other slide](#at-the-end-of-this-lecture-you-will-be-able-to) by use of the header title.

Please make your lecture precise.

- Limit the main points in a lecture to five or fewer.
- Create effective visuals, analogies, demonstrations, and examples to reinforce the main points.
  {TAs and the Parity design team can assist! Please let us know marking an item here as `TODO`}
- Emphasize your objectives and key points in the beginning, as you get to them, and as a summary at the end.

## Pre-requisites

No background in X is necessary. However, the following are expected:

- Y
- Z
- \\(\alpha\\)

---

### _At the end of this lecture, you will be able to:_

<!-- TODO: fill this in  -->

- Describe ...
- Navigate ...
- Justify ...

## XCM Configurations

Now go through and explain the various XCM configurations and hooks that can be manipulated by the user, and how that may affect XCM behavior

This then leads naturally into a concept like fee payments, which is entirely a configuration, for things like:

- What assets are supported for fees (configurable)
- How much each asset is worth in terms of weight (configurable)
- What happens to unused weight (configurable)
- Other mechanisms for being given weight (for example a stipend for certain chains, or entirely free)
- Barrier conditions

### XCM Version Negotiation

<!--

TODO add slide somewhere about this. Basically scaffold gav's second blog

## Lesson 3: Parachain Configuration for XCM

> {Likely} Instructor: RT Eng.? Shawn?

### Why is this topic Important?

### Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills

### Learning Outcome

- Understand and correctly configure XCM (pallet, executor, ...) for a parachain (exectutor and pallet) based on buisness needs
- Barriers & filters
- Asset transactors

### Learning Objectives

### Core Ideas to Convey

- XCM builder module (makes configuration easier)
- Barriers & filters
- Asset transactors
- Weight Traders
- wildcards? {maybe out of scope}

### Activities and Exercises

- Transfer native tokens from ChainA → ChainB **on Rococo** {no setup needed, }
  - Teleport
  - Reserve Asset
  - Explain what to use these given a scenario:
    - Within a chain itself `Here`
    - ParaA → ParaB
    - Relay Chain Native token to ParaA (not common good chain)
    - ... others?
