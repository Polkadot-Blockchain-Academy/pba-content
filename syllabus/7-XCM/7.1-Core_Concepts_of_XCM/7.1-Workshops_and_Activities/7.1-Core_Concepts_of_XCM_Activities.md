## Activities
  - Make XCM that does some logic, given the account balance you have on a single parachain to execute a few increasingly more complex routes to things. 
  - XCM message that is overly complex. Have student identify and rewrite with less program steps & routes
  - XCM that is HERE only, and thus should be a local extrinsic instead, have them discover this and outline the right calls.
  - Open channels manually on a testnet, configure correctly.
  - Issue XCM on a testnet

- Multiple instructions given in XCM that throws error.
  - Fix errors and configuration change
  - Works on one chain, but not another. How to fix to work for both?

ONLY use XCM simulator - not a full testnet / zombie net. Maybe polkadot-launch.

## exercises

- given starting state and instructions, what is the state after execution?
- If you are given error, describe what it means and how do you correct it?
