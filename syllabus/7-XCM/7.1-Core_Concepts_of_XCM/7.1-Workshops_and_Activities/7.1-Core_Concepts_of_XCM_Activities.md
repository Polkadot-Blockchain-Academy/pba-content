## Activities

  - XCM message that is overly complex. Have student identify and rewrite with less program steps & routes
  - XCM that is HERE only, and thus should be a local extrinsic instead, have them discover this and outline the right calls.
  - Open channels manually on a testnet, configure correctly.
  - Issue XCM on a testnet
