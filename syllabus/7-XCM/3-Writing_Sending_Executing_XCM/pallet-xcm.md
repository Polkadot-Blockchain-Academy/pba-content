<!-- TBD  -->

- Understand what the interface of the pallet is and the pallet implements.
- What is the Subscription Service and its role.
- Response Handler
- Asset Trapping

<!-- Following slides are a quick overview of the pallet interface, focusing on the calls it exposes -->
## pallet-xcm

`pallet-xcm` provides default implementations for many traits required by XcmConfig.

`pallet-xcm` also provides an interface where users can create XCM messages via 10 different extrinsics, which can be split into three categories:

- Primitive functions to locally `execute` or `send` an XCM message.
- High-lvel functions for asset tranfers.
- Extrinsics aimed exclusively at version negotiation.

---

## pallet-xcm::Primitive extrinsics

`execute`
Direct access to the XCM executor. It checks the origin, the message, and ensures no filter is blocking the execution. Then it executes fthe message **locally** and returns the outcome as an event. It is necessarily executed on behalf of the account that signed the extrinsic (origin).

`send`
This extrinsic is an interface to send a message to a destination. It checks the origin, the destination and the message. Then it forwards the message to the `XcmRouter`.

---

## pallet-xcm::Asset Transfer extrinsics

`teleport_assets` & `limited_teleport_assets`

Allow the user to perform an asset teleport. The limited version takes an extra argument (`Option<WeightLimit>`).

`reserve_transfer_assets` & `limited_reserve_transfer_assets`

Allow the user to perform a reserve-backed transfer. Its limited version takes an extra argument as well (`Option<WeightLimit>`).

---

## pallet-xcm::Version Negotiation extrinsics

Every extrinsic in this category require root as origin.

`force_xcm_version`

Modifies `SupportedVersion` value. This storage item is a double map containing information about the version supported by destinations.

`force_default_xcm_version`

Modifies the `SafeXcmVersion` storage. Its value is used as fallback version when destination version is unknown.

`force_subscribe_version_notify`

Sends an XCM message with the `SubscribeVersion` instruction to some destination.

`force_unsubscribe_version_notify`

Sends an XCM message with the `UnsubscribeVersion` instruction to some destination.

}
```
---

<!-- Getting into the subscrption service and version negotiation -->

## Subscription Service

Any system can query another for the latest XCM version it supports, and be notified when this changes. This is done via the `SubscribeVersion` and `UnsubscribeVersion` instructions.

The `SubscriptionService` type defines which action to take when processing  a `SubscribeVersion` instruction.
This type expects an implementation of `VersionChangeNotifier` trait, which has a `strat` and a `stop` function along with `is_subscribed`.

`pallet-xcm` provides a default implementaiton of this trait. When receiving a `SubscribeVersion`, the chain sends back an XCM message with the `QueryResponse` instruction containing its current version.

---

## Version Negotiation

The subscription service is laveraged at the version negotiation that occurs whenever two systems start exchanging messages.

Each time a system needs to encode a message for a destination which its supported version is unknown, its location will be stored in the `VersionDiscoveryQueue`. This queue will be checked at every block and `SubscribeVersion` instructions will be sent out to those locations populating the queue. While taking note of the queries that has been sent.

---v

## Version Negotiation Instructions

```rust
enum Instruction {
    SubscribeVersion { query_id: QueryId, max_response_weight: Weight },
    UnsubscribeVersion,
}
```

Notes:

SubscribeVersion - instructs the local system to notify the sender whenever the former has its XCM version upgraded or downgraded.
UnsubscribeVersion - if the sender was previously subscribed to XCM version change notifications for the local system, then this instruction tells the local system to stop notifying the sender on version changes.

---v

## üó£Ô∏è XCM Version Negotiation

XCM version negotiation:
<pba-flex center>

1. Chain A sends `SubscribeVersion` to chain B.
1. Chain B responds `QueryResponse` to chain A with the same query_id and max_weight params, and puts the XCM version in the response
1. Chain A stores chain B's supported version on storage.
1. The same procedure happens from chain B to chain A.
1. Communication is established using the highest mutually supported version.

## Response Handler

Version negotiation is just one example among many kinds of queries one chain can make to another. Regardless of which kiind of query was made, the response usually takes the form of a `QueryResponse` instruction.

The `ResponseHandler` type requires an implementation of the `OnResponse`trait, which defines actions to be performed when receiving `QueryResponse` instructions back from a query.

A default implementation is provided by the `pallet-xcm`. It checks that the response id is expected, and processes it when receiving it. It rejects any response that it did not query beforehand.

---v

## Information Reporting Instructions

```rust
enum Instruction {
    ReportError(QueryResponseInfo),
    ReportHolding { response_info: QueryResponseInfo, assets: MultiAssetFilter },
    ReportTransactStatus(QueryResponseInfo),
    QueryPallet { module_name: Vec<u8>, response_info: QueryResponseInfo },
}
```

```rust
pub struct QueryResponseInfo {
    pub destination: MultiLocation,
    pub query_id: QueryId,
    pub max_weight: Weight,
}
```

Notes:

All of these instructions contain a `QueryResponseInfo` struct, which contains information about the intended destination of the response, the ID of the query, and the maximum weight that the dispatchable call function can use.
The dispatchable call function is an optional operation that XCM author can specify, and is executed upon receiving the response, effectively acting as a lifecycle hook on response.

---v

## Information

```rust
enum Instruction {
    QueryResponse { query_id: QueryId, response: Response, max_weight: Weight, querier: Option<MultiLocation> },
}
```

Offering some requested information that the local system is expecting

Notes:

This instruction is generally safe to execute, the only tidbit here is that the local system may not be expecting the response from the sender.
Therefore, the `querier` parameter should be checked to ensure that the system that requested the information matches with what is expected.

---
## Asset Trapping

What happens when there are still funds in the `HoldingRegister` after the execution of every instruction is done ?

`pallet-xcm` implements the `DropAssets` trait which defines what to do with the funds. The current implementation traps these assets by adding an asset trap. Then these funds will need to be eventually claimed back by the same origin via `AssetClaims` instruction, which requires the implementation of `ClaimAssets` trait.

These traps are stored in `AssetTraps`, a map where the key is the blake2 (256bits) of the `(origin, assets)` tuple. The storage value is the number of times this tuple has been trapped. The user have to perform as many claims as traps occured.
