### Outline

<!--
You can reference slides within this presentation like [this other slide](#at-the-end-of-this-lecture-you-will-be-able-to) by use of the header title.

Please make your lecture precise.

- Limit the main points in a lecture to five or fewer.
- Create effective visuals, analogies, demonstrations, and examples to reinforce the main points.
  {TAs and the Parity design team can assist! Please let us know marking an item here as `TODO`}
- Emphasize your objectives and key points in the beginning, as you get to them, and as a summary at the end.

## Pre-requisites

No background in cryptography is necessary. However, the following are expected:

- Basic mathematical maturity
- Comfort with basic probability
- Basic familiarity with asymptotic (Big-O)
  notation
- Programming capability (in Python/Java, etc.)
- \\(\alpha\\)

# What is Cryptography?

---

## How do _you_ define Cryptography?

### What can you _do_ with cryptographic techniques?

Notes:
EXERCISE - spend 3 to 5 minuets on this.
Start by asking for class to answer, no wrong answers!

<!-- TODO: exercise indicator https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-blockchain-academy/issues/67 -->

---

## What does Cryptography solve for blockchains?

---

## Applied Cryptographic Primitives

<!-- TODO

https://github.com/PratyushRT/blockchainsS21/blob/master/LectureSlides/

use lesson 1&2 in these to develop slides in this section.
FOCUS ON APPLICATION - deeper logic of how they work should bereferenced only, and left as references & exercices for students _after_ academy.

- Symmetric & Asymmetric Encryption
- Digital Signatures
- Hashes
- Erasure Coding

## Encryption

This is something you've all heard about in the context of cryptography. "Encrypted" messages in
Telegram, etc. Secret transfer of a message between someone and someone else. Enigma, etc.

Solves the problem of getting a message from one party to another without it being interceptable by
others.

- HTTPs uses encryption

We don't use it so much in Substrate; we use it in the network.

## Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Key Cryptography

TODO: Define here, reference glossary

<!-- TODO unpack slides from https://www.jigsawacademy.com/blogs/cyber-security/symmetric-and-asymmetric-key-cryptography -->

---
We always need a function that’s easy to compute but hard to reverse.

Symmetric crypto mixes unrelated mathematical operations, ala bitwise and arithmetic.

Examples:

    Hash functions: large input, small-ish output.
    Provide fingerprinting, commitments,
    Pseudo-random generators (PRNGs): small-ish input key, arbitrarily long output.

Asymmetric crypto works only with one mathematical object’s arithmetic, which gives homomorphic properties, but demands some inverse operation be much harder, ala division by multiplication.

Examples:

    Key exchange mix two people secret,
    Signatures proof-knowledge of some secret,
    Zero-knowledge proofs of correct evaluation of some circuit (signatures being a simple special case)

---

## Digital Signatures

- Solves for Problems:
  - How do you prove that possessions are yours?
  - How do you make sure that one person can do something and others can't
  - How do we know that you are you?
- asymmetric/public key cryptography
  - mathematic requirements
    - example: elliptic curve

There are lots of types of signatures!

---

## Hashes

(such as Fingerprints/Digests)

- Solves For Problems:
  - How do we ensure we have the same shared history?
  - How do we know we referring to the same referent?
  - How can we ensure that we are assured that what we are looking at comes from the same
    truth?
- The source of truth comes from the same Merkle root, and this convinces everyone else;
- Metaphor: Fingerprint
- Metaphor: A bibliographic reference referring to a book in a library; how can we follow it
  backward to a shared, reliable reference AND verify that is a perfect representation of a
  small part of a huge corpus of data?
  - Example: In this book on this page on this library, but you need to know using only a
    small piece of information

Hashes can be used in lots of ways!

---

## Applied Hashing

A hash is used as a commitment a _single string_. What if we want to commit to something that's
structured, that we want to verify a small part of (a fundamental need in Blockchain cryptography)?

- Merkle Trees are a hash-based data structure that entails lots of hashing.
- Merkle Tree is a commitment to a list or set, that can be enormous.
- A Merkle Trie is a commitment to a database. Tree that does a specific thing, which is looking
  up values from keys.

A blockchain is also a hash-based data structure(!)

Could be for a single piece of data (a hash is a commitment for a single piece)

- For a Merkle tree, you're only interested in a particular piece of it
- Instances include: - Merkle Root: Summary of the data that you can compare against. Single hash
  you get from the library. It's a commitment to everything in the library. - Merkle Proof:
  Convinces you that it's the right referent, kind of a lookup path to verify that the data came
  from the database with the Merkle Root - The Merkle root is the thing we're agreeing on and that
  the authority is giving us, but the Merkle PROOF can come from anywhere.

* "A hash function, otherwise known as a one-way hash function, takes an arbitrary message of
  arbitrary length and creates an output (a hash) of a fixed length. The main characteristics of a
  cryptographic hash function are that given a message, it is easy to compute the hash; given the
  hash, it is difficult to compute the message; and that given a message, it is difficult to find
  a different message that would produce the same hash (this is known as a collision)""

## Commitments

(using hashes & signatures)

## Erasure Coding

That's the last primitive we use, but we'll get into later.
