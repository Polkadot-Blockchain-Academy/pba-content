# Lesson 3: Digital Signatures (Part 2)

## Learning Outcome

By the end of this lesson, learners will be able to utilize the optimal digital signature tools based on business logic required  for the Web3 application.

## Core Ideas to Convey

What types of signatures do distributed systems use? Where? Why?
* What are used on substrate? (EDCSA , ed25519, sr25519 etc.)
* What do other chains use? Why? secp256k1(why did substrate move away from this?), others
* Schnorr and EDSA signatures

*The exotics above should be explained, but not coded*

3. Key Splitting
4. HDKD (Can be coded)
5. Maybe some signature stuff from 4, e.g. BLS (not coded), aggregated signatures.
