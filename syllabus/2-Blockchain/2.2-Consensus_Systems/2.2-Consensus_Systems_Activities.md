# BitStory: Hands-on Consensus games

In this activity students will encounter and explore blockchain consensus mechanisms (especially PoW) by acting them out manually.

Students will collaborate in telling a shared story. The shared story is represented by a blockchain with one word in each block. To add a word to the story, a student must create a valid block, and draw that block on the community whiteboard*

* If no whiteboard is available, you may be able to substitute, a paper, online drawing tool, or even a chalkboard if you are desparate.

## Proof of Work

The PoW phase is the original, and a working hasher tool is available here: https://joshorndorff.github.io/BitStory/bitStoryLive.html

To begin we'll explore the Nakamoto style Proof of Work. To add a block a student must:
* Choose a parent block hash to build on
* Choose a word to add to the story
* Find a nonce so that the block's hash meets the required difficulty

The process of finding a nonce is accomplished by entering the parent hash and word into [the hasher](https://joshorndorff.github.io/BitStory/bitStoryLive.html) and repeatedly mashing the `increment nonce` button until you find a valid one. In this way students are manually performing the preimage search.

You may choose that the game ends at a certain time. You may choose a winner by who created the most blocks. Or who made the story unfold most to their liking

### Additions

The instructor can encourage student groups to perform various attacks on the PoW network.

* Censor specific words or plot points by forking around them
* Perform a hard fork where your block start to have two words each. Some students will like the two-words-per-block rule and keep building on them. Other students (ideally ones who don't know the instructor is in on the shenanigans) may think the two-word blocks are not following the rules, and choose to ignore them. Welcome to bitstory cash.


## Proof of Authority (Aura)
In this phase, students will choose some authorities to act as block authors and a slot duration and they will take turns authoring in order. They should observe that this method is much simpler and less chaotic. It does indeed take less work.

Again, the instructor introduces some chaos

* Encourage some authorities to skip their slots
* Encourage authorities to censor words.
* Polarize the authorites to work on two different forks

## Discussion
What attacks worked best in PoW vs PoA. What strengths and eweaknesses does each have.

## Rotating Authorities
Challenge the students to consider whays in which the authority set might change. What if the story itself is about who is elected as authorities.

Notice that this is the foundation of proof of stake. The on-chain story is about people bonding and unbonding their security deposits.

## Grandpa

This one is a little different. Here we assume an external block production method. At first this can just be one student who is not playing grandpa, but instead being the sole block producer.

The other students use a shared whiteboard to post their pre-votes and pre-commits and personal paper to track which blocks they have finalized.

## Hybrid Consensus
If their is time in the activity slot, we can cobine any of the block production methods with grandpa. My personal favorite is PoW + Grandpa.
