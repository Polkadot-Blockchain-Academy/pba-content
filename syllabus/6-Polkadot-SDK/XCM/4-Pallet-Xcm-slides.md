## What you'll learn

- The link between XCM and FRAME

---

# How XCM can be used

- Interacting directly with the executor by writing XCMs

or

- Packaging up all XCM-logic on extrinsics

---

# The XCM Pallet

We have now learnt about the XCVM and FRAME.

The XCM pallet is the bridge between the XCVM subsystem and the FRAME subsystem.

**It allows us both to interact with the executor directly and provides useful extrinsics**.

## Some functionalities of the pallet

- Executing xcms locally.
- Sending xcms to a different location.
- Transferring assets to a different consensus system
- Version negotiation
- Handling responses
- Claiming trapped assets

# Summary

- Learnt how to link XCM and FRAME.
- Learnt what the XCM pallet does.

# Workshop

We're going to write our own version of some extrinsics from the XCM pallet.
