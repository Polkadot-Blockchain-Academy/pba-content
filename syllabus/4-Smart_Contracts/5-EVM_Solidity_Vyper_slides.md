# EVM

Ethereum Virtual Machine

* A VM designed specifically for the constraints and features of Ethereum

---v

## EVM Properties

* Deterministic: execution outcome easy to agree upon
* Spam-resistant: Opcodes and other resources are metered at a very granular level
* Turing-complete (with a caveat)
* Stack-based design
* Ethereum-specific (EVM can query block hash, accounts and balances, etc.)

Note:

It is critical that the EVM be 100% deterministic and that each implementation
produce the same outcome. Even the smallest discrepancy between two running
nodes would lead to different block hashes, violating consensus about the
results.

Charging appropriately for each opcode is also critical in order to prevent
abuse. Opcodes which are underpriced can allow spam, allowing attackers to
force the network to do more work than are paid for by fees, or even outright
DoS.

---v

## Turing completeness and the Halting Problem

* EVM: Turing-complete instruction set

* But what about the Halting Problem?
* Obviously cannot allow infinite loops
* Solution: Gasometer, a way to pre-pay for each opcode execution

Note:

The Halting Problem tells us that it's not possible to know that an arbitrary
program will properly stop. To prevent such abuse, we check that there is gas
remaining before every single opcode execution. Since gas is limited, this
ensures that no EVM execution will run forever and that all work performed is
properly paid for.

---v

## Gasometer

<img style="width: 100%; margin: 10px" src="img/frontier/GasometerDiagram.png" />

* Checks before each opcode to make sure gas can be paid
* Safe: prevents unpaid work from being done
* Deterministic: results are unambiguous
* Very inefficient: lots of branching and extra work

Note: This not only makes it possible to prevent abuse, but crucially allows
nodes to agree on doing so. A centralized service could easily impose a time
limit, but decentralized nodes wouldn't be able to agree on the outcome of such
a limit (or trust each other).

---v

## Gas

The unit of account for EVM execution resources.

* `gas_limit`: specifies the maximum amount of gas a txn can pay
* `gas_price`: specifies the exact price a txn will pay per gas

A txn *must* be able to pay `gas_limit * gas_price` in order to be valid. This
amount is initially deducted from the txn's sender account and any remaining gas
is refunded after the txn has executed.

---v

## EIP-1559

An improvement to gas pricing mechanism. Introduced in London hard-fork.

```
gas_price --> max_base_fee_per_gas
          \-> max_priority_fee_per_gas
```

* Separates tip from gas price
* `base_fee` is an algorithmic gas price, this is exactly what is paid and is burned
* ...plus maybe tip if (`base_fee < max_base_fee + max_priority_fee`)
* Algorithmic, congestion-based multiplier controls `base_fee`

---v

## Gas Estimation

If a txn exhausts its `gas_limit` without finishing, it will produce an
out-of-gas error and all changes made in the EVM are reverted (except for fee
payment).

In order to estimate the amount of gas a txn will need, an RPC method
(`eth_estimateGas`) can perform a dry-run of the txn and record the amount
used.

However, there are a few caveats:

* Run against current state (state may change)
* The RPC node could lie to you
* This is expensive infrastructure overhead and can be a spam vector

# History of EVM

(TODO)

ideas:
* Early concepts (IIRC, was attempted to be built on Bitcoin first)
* Shortcomings of Ethereum (storage bloat, ...?)
* DAO & hardfork
* Important updates, Eth 2.0

---v

## Ethereum as first smart contracting platform

(TODO)

ideas: talk about the real-world problems that we can reflect on
* performance
* frontrunning (etc)
* hacks
* problems with aggregating smart contract protocols together

---v

## Idiosyncrasies

(TODO)

- Everything is 256bits
- No floating point arithmetic
- Revert
- Reentrancy
- ABI
- Exponential memory expansion cost

---

# EVM Concepts

---v

## Contract accounts vs EOAs

An account is designated by a 160-bit account ID. These accounts can be controlled in
one of two ways: An `Externally-owned Account` or a `Contract Account`.

### Externally-owned Account (EOA)

* Traditional user-controlled account
* Can only be controlled via transactions signed with corresponding private keys
* Account ID generated by hashing public key

### Contract Account

* Controlled by code
* Created with immutable contract bytecode
* May only ever do precisely what the code specifies
* Account ID generated deterministically when bytecode is deployed

---v

## Transactions

TODO: format this slide better

All interactions which potentially change EVM state must come from signed
transactions. The transaction's signature allows for the public key (and
thereby the account id) to be recovered. The transaction must specify how
much gas it is willing to pay and the sending account must be able to pay
for this up front.

Only an EoA can send a transaction since a contract account
does not have a private key.

#### Transactions can:

* Send 0 or more Ether to some other account

#### And optionally either:

* Call an external function on an existing contract
* OR Create a new contract

---v

## Transaction Structure

TODO: show transaction contents

---v

## Bytecode

Executable code is stored on-chain in the form of bytecode. Only `Contract
Account`s have bytecode, and this bytecode controls what these accounts do when
they are interacted with.

TODO: example bytecode, etc.

---v

## Sandboxed Contract State

`Contract Account`s contain a sandboxed state, which stores everything that the
contract writes to storage. Contracts may not write to storage outside of their
own sandbox, but they can call other contracts whose bytecode *might* write to
their respective storage.

---v

## Calling contracts

TODO: talk about different ways to call (may need more context first)

---

# Programming the EVM

The EVM is ultimately programmed by creating bytecode. While it is possible to
write bytecode by hand or through low-level assembly language, it is much more
practical to use a higher-level language. We will look at two in particular:

* Solidity
* Vyper

---

# Solidity

* Designed for EVM
* Similar to C++, Java, etc.
* Includes inheritance (including MI)
* Criticized for being difficult to reason about security

---v

## Basics

```Solidity
// 'contract' is analogous to 'class' in other OO languages
contract Foo {
    // the member variables of a contract are stored on-chain
    public uint bar;

    constructor(uint value) {
        bar = value;
    }
}
```

---v

## Functions

```Solidity
contract Foo {
    function doSomething() public returns (bool) {
        return true;
    }
}
```

---v

## Payable

```Solidity
contract Foo {
    uint256 received;
    // this function can be called with value (Ether) given to it.
    // in this simple example, the contract would never do anything with
    // the Ether (effectively meaning it would be lost), but it will faithfully
    // track the amount paid to it
    function deposit() public payable {
        received += msg.value;
    }
}
```

---v

## Types: "Value" Types

```Solidity
contract Foo {
    // Value types are stored in-place in memory and require
    // a full copy during assignment.
    function valueTypes() public {
        bool b = false;

        // signed and unsigned ints
        int32 i = -1;
        int256 i2 = -10000;
        uint8 u1 = 255;
        uint16 u2 = 10000;
        uint256 u3 = 99999999999999;

        // fixed length byte sequence (from 1 to 32 bytes)
        // many bitwise operators can be performed on these
        bytes1 oneByte = 0x01;

        // address represents a 20-byte Ethereum address
        address a = 0x1010101010101010101010101010101010101010;
        uint256 balance = a.balance;

        // also: Enums

        // each variable is an independent copy
        int x = 1;
        int y = x;
        y = 2;
        require(x == 1);
        require(x == 2);
    }

}
```

---v

## Types: "Reference" Types

```Solidity
Contract Foo {
    // Reference types are stored as a reference to some other location. Only
    // their reference must be copied during assignment.
    contract Foo {
    mapping(uint => uint) forLater;

    // Reference types are stored as a reference to some other location. Only
    // their reference must be copied during assignment.
    function referenceTypes() public {
        // arrays
        uint8[3] memory arr = [1, 2, 3];

        // mapping: can only be initialized from state variables
        mapping(uint => uint) storage balances = forLater;
        balances[0] = 500;

        // dynamic length strings
        string memory foo = "<3 Solidity";

        // also: Structs

        // Two or more variables can share a reference, so be careful!
        uint8[3] memory arr2 = arr;
        arr2[0] = 42;
        require(arr2[0] == 42);
        require(arr[0] == 42); // arr and arr2 are the same thing, so mod to one affects the other
    }
}
}
```

---v

## Data Location

`Data Location` refers to the storage of `Reference Types`. As these are passed
by reference, it effectively dictates where this reference points to. It can be
one of 3 places:

* memory: Stored only in memory; cannot outlive a given external function call
* storage: Stored in the contract's permanent on-chain storage
* calldata: read-only data, using this can avoid copies

---v

## Data Location Sample

```Solidity
contract DataLocationSample {
    struct Foo {
        int i;
    }

    Foo storedFoo;

    // Data Location specifiers affect function arguments and return values...
    function test(Foo memory val) public returns (Foo memory) {
        // ...and also variables within a function
        Foo memory copy = val;

        // storage varables must be assigned befor use.
        Foo storage fooFromStorage = storedFoo;
        fooFromStorage.i = 1;
        require(storedFoo.i == 1, "writes to storage variables affect storage");

        // memory variables can be initialized from storage variables
        // (but not the other way around)
        copy = fooFromStorage;

        // but they are an independent copy
        copy.i = 2;
        require(copy.i == 2);
        require(storedFoo.i == 1, "writes to memory variables cannot affect storage");

        return fooFromStorage;
    }
}
```

---v

## Enums

```Solidity
contract Foo {
    enum Suite {
        Hearts,
        Diamonds,
        Clubs,
        Spades
    }

    function getHeartsSuite() public returns (Suite) {
        Suite hearts = Suite.Hearts;
        return hearts;
    }
}
```

---v

## Structs

```Solidity
contract Foo {
    struct Ballot {
        uint32 index;
        string name;
    }

    function makeSomeBallot() public returns (Ballot memory) {
        Ballot memory ballot;
        ballot.index = 1;
        ballot.name = "John Doe";
        return ballot;
    }
}
```

---v

## Ether Denominations

Ether is 10**18 wei (TODO: elaborate, tie in to types / uint256)

---

## Solidity Hands-On

---v

## Dev Environment

We will use the online [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org) for our sample
coding. It provides an editor, compiler, EVM, and debugger all within the
browser, making it trivial to get started.

---v

## Flipper Example

Code along and explain as you go

---v

## Deployment and interaction with Flipper

---v

## Adder or Multiplier

write, deploy, interact

Stephen: adder or multiplier is trivially different than flipper (discuss)

# Vyper

* Also designed for the EVM
* Similar to Python
* Intentionally lacks some features such as inheritance
* Auditable: "Simplicity for the reader is more important than simplicity for the writer"

---v

## Compared to Solidity

Vyper mostly lacks features found in Solidity, all in the spirit of improving
readability. Some examples:

* No Inheritance
* No modifiers (TODO: cover this under Solidity)
* No function overloading
* No recursive calling (!)
* No infinite-loops

---v

## Basics

```Python
# There is no `contract` keyword. Like Python Modules, a contract is implicitly
# scoped by the file in which it is found.

# storage variables are declared outside of any function
bar: uint

# init is used to deploy a contract and initialize its state
@external
def __init__(val):
    self.bar = val
```

---v

## Functions

```Python
@external
def doSomething() -> bool:
    return True
```

---v

## Decorators and Payable

```Python
# Vyper contains decorators for restricting functions:

@external # function can only be called externally
@internal # function can only be called within current context
@pure # cannot read state or environment vars
@view # cannot alter contract state
@payable # function may receive Ether

# also, to cover the most common use case for Solidity's modifiers:
@nonreentrant(<unique_key>) # prevents reentrancy for given id
```

source: https://docs.vyperlang.org/en/stable/control-structures.html#decorators-reference

---v

## Types

```Python
# value types are small and/or fixed size and are copied
@external
def valueTypes():
    b: bool = False

    # signed and unsigned ints
    i: int128 = -1
    i2: int256 = -10000
    # u: uint128 = 42 # TODO: docs say int<multiple of 8> should work...
    u2: uint256 = 42

    # fixed-point (base-10) decimal values with 10 decimal points of precision
    # this has the advantage that literals can be precisely expressed
    f: decimal = 0.1 + 0.3 + 0.6
    assert f == 1.0, "decimal literals are precise!"

    # address type for 20-byte Ethereum addresses
    a: address = 0x1010101010101010101010101010101010101010
    b = a.balance

    # fixed size byte arrays
    selector: bytes4 = 0x12345678

    # bounded byte arrays
    bytes: Bytes[123] = b"\x01"

    # dynamic-length strings
    name: String[16] = "Vyper"

# reference types are potentially large and/or dynamicly sized.
# they are copied-by-reference
@external
def referenceTypes():
    # fixed size list. can also be multidimensional.
    # all elements must be initialized
    list: int128[4] = [1, 2, 3, -4]

    # bounded, dynamic-size array. these have a max size but initialize to empty
    dynArray: DynArray[int128, 3]
    dynArray.append(1)
    dynArray.append(5)
    val: int128 = dynArray.pop() # == 5

    map: HashMap[int128, int128]
    map[0] = 0
    map[1] = 10
    map[2] = 20

```

---v

## Enums

```Python
enum Suite {
    Hearts,
    Diamonds,
    Clubs,
    Spades
}

# "hearts" would be considered a value type
hearts: Suite = Suite.Hearts
```

---v

## Structs

```Python
struct Ballot:
    index: uint256
    name: string

# "someBallot" would be considered a reference type
someBallot: Ballot = Ballot({index: 1, name: "John Doe"})
name: string = someBallot.name
```

---v

## Remix Plugin

Remix supports Vyper through a plugin, which can be easily enabled from within
the IDE. (TODO: provide a few screenshots or other instructions)

---v

## EVM Assembly

# Storing or Secrets On-Chain

TODO: format this -- how to do the one-click-per-line thing?

Can we store secrets on-chain? What if we want to password-protect a particular
contract call?

Obviously we can't store any plaintext secrets on-chain, as doing so reveals
them.

---v

## Storing Hashed Secrets On-Chain

What about storing the hash of a password on chain and using this to verify some
user-input?

Accepting a pre-hash also reveals the secret. This reveal may occur in a txn
before it is executed and settled, allowing someone to frontrun it.

---v

## Verifying with commit-reveal

One potential solution is a commit-reveal scheme where we hash our reveal with
some salt, then later reveal it.

```
// stored on-chain:
secret_hash = hash(secret)
```

```
// first txn, this must execute and settle on chain before the final reveal.
// this associates a user with the soon-to-be-revealed secret
commitment = hash(salt, alleged_secret)
```

```
// final reveal, this must not be made public until commitment is recorded
reveal = alleged_secret, salt
verify(alleged_secret == secret)
verify(commitment == hash(salt, alleged_secret))
```

---v

## Alternative: Signature

Another approach is to use public-key cryptography. We can store the public key
of some keypair and then demand a signature from the corresponding private-key.

This can be expanded with multisig schemes and similar.

How does this differ from the commit-reveal scheme?

Note:

Commit-reveal requires that a specific secret be revealed at some point for
verification. A signature scheme provides a lot more flexibility for keeping the
secret(s) secure.

# TODO

##### Some things that I think are currently lacking:

* Clean up (merge slides, reorder)
* Visual aids
* Various ways to call a contract
* Transactions
* Non-transactions (view calls / RPC queries)
* Solidity modifiers
* revert (raise in Vyper)
* Ether denominations (and esp. talk about advantages of integer math)
* Precompiles (original ones, plus what moonbeam has done?)
* link to Ethernaut, etc.
* checksum cases
* Loops - introduce in solidity but cover in more depth with vyper (no inf loops)

##### And some that I will probably leave out of scope
* Assembly
* ABI explanation, this is potentially a big (and dry?) topic
* call data
