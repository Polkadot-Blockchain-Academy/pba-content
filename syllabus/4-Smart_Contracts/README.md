# Smart Contracts Module

This module introduces students to the concept of smart contracts and how they are a natural extension to the existing field of contracts.
We will learn that computer programs can express formal agreements and act as an efficient and impartial alternative to a court or judge.
We will also understand the importance of running such contracts on a trustworthy platform and see that blockchain can provide such a platform.

## Collaboration with Blockchain Module

In some PBA offerings, this module is slated to be taught immediately after the module on Blockchain Fundamentals.
When this is the case, these two modules can be intertwined to achieve a more compelling learning experience.

This intertwined approach begins with the Smart Contracts instructor defining and motivating the concept of a Smart contract, and leaving students wondering where such a contract could execute.
It continues with the Blockchain instructor showing that a blockchain is a perfect place to run a smart contract, and introduces the technical aspects according to this module.
Next, the Smart Contracts instructor gives students hands on experience building smart contracts in common blockchain-oriented programming environments.
Finally, the super-module concludes with an activity in which students launch a blockchain and participate as node operators, then launch their own smart contracts on top of the just-launched blockchain.

When taught as a collaboration, the super-module requires roughly 5 days.
For more details, see the [Hybrid Lesson Outline](../3-Blockchain/Outline_Hybrid.md) from the Blockchain module.

## Independent Module

When the aforementioned collaboration with the blockchain module is not practical, this module may still be taught standalone.
When taught as a standalone entity, the module requires roughly 2.5 - 3 days.
For more details, see the [Standalone Lesson Outline](Outline_Standalone.md).
