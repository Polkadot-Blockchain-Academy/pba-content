# Smart Contracts Module

This module introduces students to the concept of smart contracts and how they are a natural extension to the existing field of contracts.
We will learn that computer programs can express formal agreements and act as an efficient and impartial alternative to a court or judge.
We will also understand the importance of running such contracts on a trustworthy platform and see that blockchain can provide such a platform.
