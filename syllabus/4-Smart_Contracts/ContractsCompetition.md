# Contracts Competition

A half-day hands-on exercise/competition/game where students build hands on experience interacting with smart contracts while competing to acquire the most tokens.

## Big Picture Goal

We want students to engage in al kinds of activity to try to get tokens by legitimate or illegitimate means.
We want students to stay engaged the entire time but also be free to explore.

## Faucet / UBI

We don't want students to go broke and be out for the rest of the day, so we need some kind of UBI pallet on the chain that gives each registered address new tokens each block or each few blocks.
Maybe the payout can increase as the competition goes on so the stakes get higher.

## Ideas

We need to build enough structure that students will have something concrete to try when they are stuck, but flexible enough that excited students can explore.

* Deploy your contract from the previous day
* Earn coins by mining
* Gamble in a casino
* Hack a contract
* Participate in DeFi to earn yield
* Fork the chain around blocks that you don't like
* Speculate on shitcoins
* Launch a shitcoin (and rug your friends)
* Ethernaut - https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/
* Have some buried treasure contracts or ethernaut like challenges for students to be able to extract.
* Send them challenges like partially leaked keys and see who can brute force that key to get some new coins.
* Maybe release a new puzzle every few minutes.
* Ink game described in the adjacent slides
* Flashloans a la https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3156
* Re-entrancy challenge or task

## Disclosures

Have a closing discussion (or perhaps a few discussions throughout) where people discuss strategies they are using to gain tokens.
