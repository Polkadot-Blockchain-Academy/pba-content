## Ecosystem and Economy

This presentation will give you a high level overview of the ecosystem and economy of the Polkadot Network.

Unfortunately this presentation could never be fully exhaustive, but perhaps it will shed light on areas previously unknown.

## The DOT Token

<div>

<div class="text-left">

DOT is the native token of the Polkadot Network.

DOT tokens can be in one of the following states:

1. Transferable
2. Reserved (held)
3. Frozen (locked)

## Reserved vs Frozen Balance

- DOT in both states belong to the user... but cannot be spent / transferred.
- Reserved balances stack on top of one another (no overlay).
  - Example: Staking and deposits for storing data on-chain (identities, proxies, multisig, OpenGov).
- Frozen balances can overlay with each other, and with reserved balances.
  - Example: Vested transfers and OpenGov votes.

## Storage Bloat

One blockchain scaling problem is storage bloat over time.

<br />

Consider the "cost" of storing data on Ethereum:

- A one time gas fee based on the amount of data stored.
- Once is it placed on the network, it lives there forever, with no additional costs.
- Over a long enough period of time, the cost of storage per time will reduce to zero.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Storage Deposits

To solve this problem, Polkadot additionally takes a storage deposit (in the form of Reserved Balance) for any data stored in the blockchain.

- This deposit is returned to the user when the user removes the data from the chain.

- This deposit can be quite extreme, since it is returned to the user, and can represent the impermanence or lack of "importance" of the data.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Dust Accounts & Existential Deposit

The most bloat-ful storage on most blockchains are user accounts:

- Both Ethereum and Bitcoin are riddled with "dust accounts" which have such a small balance, they are not worth "cleaning up".

- Polkadot solves this by having an "existential deposit" that all users must hold a minimum amount of DOT, else their account data will be cleaned up.

- Existential deposit can be thought of as a storage deposit for account data.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Scaling with Data Sharding

- Polkadot is already designed to scale by sharding data.
  - Polkadot only needs to store the merkle root representing large amounts of data.
- The cost to store data on shards are orders of magnitude cheaper.
  - We can have decreased storage deposits on these shards:
    - ED: 1.0 DOT on Polkadot -> .01 DOT on Asset Hub
    - Identity: 20 DOT on Polkadot -> .2 DOT on People Chain

## DOT Inflation

<div>

<div class="text-left">

DOT is currently configured to have a fixed inflation of 120M DOT per year.

This means that inflation rate is decreasing over time.

Newly minted tokens are distributed to the treasury and stakers in 15/85 proportion.

## Blockspace

.. is an umbrella term!

Blockspace is the capacity of a blockchain to finalize and commit operations. It represents a blockchain's security, computing, and storage capabilities as an end product.

Blockspace is not measured the same on any chain; there is no standard unit for blockspace. In Bitcoin, blockspace is based on transaction size, in Ethereum, on how much computation is used (gas), and in Polkadot, on how much time is taken to execute a task on a virtual core (coretime).
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Blockspace Properties

- Flexibility: What can you do with blockspace? What can you store on the state?
- Security: How easy is to revert that state of the chain?
- Availability: How easy is to get your hands on blockspace?

<div class="text-left col-span-2">

The DOT token serves multiple purposes to help the Polkadot Network function:

- Purchasing Coretime
- Staking
- Voting in Governance
- Paying for fees and deposits on Relay Chain and System Chains

## DOT Utility: Purchasing Coretime

Polkadot is a decentralized computer that provides secure and verifiable computation.

Polkadot schedules rollup data processing on a virtual multi-core CPU.

Rollup Chains can access Polkadot's computation via virtual cores by purchasing coretime **only** with the DOT token.

- Coretime allows agile scheduling of Polkadot's computation under the assumption that cores are a resource available for anyone to use.
- Coretime can be split or interlaced allowing concurrent computation on the same core.
- A rollup can be scheduled on multiple cores leveraging parallel computation.
- Coretime sales use periodic Dutch auctions.

## DOT Utility: Staking

<div class="grid grid-cols-3">

<div class="col-span-2 text-left">

Given the existence of a value bearing token, it can be used to provide security to Polkadot:

- If users want to provide security to the network, they can stake their tokens.

- Stakers are rewarded for good behavior, and punished for bad behavior.

- Punishment is designed to maximize the costs for a rational actor and thereby deter misbehavior.

In the staking system, there are two roles:

- Validators: Those who run block producing / parachain validating nodes for Polkadot.
- Nominators: Users who place their tokens behind validators they think will perform their job well.

Validators (and their nominators) are rewarded based on work done for the network.

## Track Parameters

The OpenGov system has different voting tracks which have different levels of power, and proportionally different level of difficulty to pass.

Here are just some of the currently 15 tracks:

| ID  |       Origin       | Decision Deposit | Prepare Period | Decision Period | Confirm Period | Min Enactment Period |
| :-: | :----------------: | :--------------: | :------------: | :-------------: | :------------: | :------------------: |

## Example: Root Origin

The origin with the highest level of privileges. Requires extremely high levels of approval and support for early passing. The prepare and enactment periods are also large.

<image src="../../assets/img/7-Polkadot/eco/root-curve.png" style="width: 800px;">

For instance, a referendum proposed in this track needs to amass 48.2% support (total network issuance) by the end of the first day with over 93.5% approval to be considered to be part of the confirm period.

</div>
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Conviction Voting

Polkadot utilizes an idea called voluntary locking / conviction voting.

This allows token holders to increase their voting power by locking up their tokens for a longer period of time.

```text
votes = tokens * conviction_multiplier
```

The conviction multiplier increases the vote multiplier by one every time the number of lock periods double.

<div class="text-small">

| Lock Periods | Vote Multiplier | Length in Days |
| ------------ | --------------- | -------------- |
| 0            | 0.1             | 0              |
| 1            | 1               | 7              |
| 2            | 2               | 14             |
| 4            | 3               | 28             |

## Treasury

<div class="grid grid-cols-3">

<div class="text-left col-span-2">

Polkadot has an on-chain treasury which is used to support permissionless and decentralized development of the network.

- Treasury gets its funds through inflation (15% of 120M DOT), slashing, 80% of transaction fees, and direct transfers.

- Treasury will automatically burn a 1% of its funds every spending period (24 days), placing pressure on spending the tokens.

## A Future Full of Clients

The Web3 Foundation is allocating 10 Million DOT for creating a diverse ecosystem of Polkadot clients.

This can help provide additional resilience to the network from software bugs.
</script></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## System Chains

- System Chains contain core Polkadot protocol features, on a rollup chain rather than Polkadot itself.
- Polkadot's Relay Chian becomes more and more transactionless, and all user-generated transactions happen at the "edges".
- System Chains have allocated coretime by governance. They _de-facto_ they are the "official" Polkadot rollups, and DOT is used for deposits and fees.

Current:

- Asset Hub: Allows creation and registration of tokens (FT & NFTs).
- Bridge Hub: A chain for managing bridges to other networks.
- Coretime Chain: responsible for the sales of coretime.
- Collectives: Acts as a place for coordination of the Polkadot DAOs.
- People Chain: A chain for managing identity and Personhood.

Future:

- Governance: Manage all the various proposals and tracks.
- Staking: Manage all the validator and nominator logic, rewards, etc...
