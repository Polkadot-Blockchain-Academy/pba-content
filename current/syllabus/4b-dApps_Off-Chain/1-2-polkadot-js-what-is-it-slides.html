### Polkadot-JS Dependency Tree

<img rounded style="width: 900px" src="./img/polkadot-js-dep-tree.png" />

<aside class="notes"><p>This image shows the complex dependency structure of the Polkadot-JS ecosystem. The various packages are highly interconnected, with core utilities at the base and more specialized tools building on them.</p>
<p>This dependency structure illustrates both a strength and a weakness of Polkadot-JS. On one hand, it promotes code reuse and consistency across the ecosystem. On the other hand, it creates tight coupling that can make it difficult to use individual components without pulling in much of the entire system.</p>
<p>Understanding this dependency structure is important for developers working with Polkadot-JS, as it helps explain some of the challenges in bundle size optimization and maintenance that we&#39;ll discuss in the limitations section.</p>

### @polkadot/wasm - WebAssembly Cryptography

<pba-flex center>

- WASM implementations of cryptographic functions
- Performance optimization for critical operations
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Bridge between Rust and JavaScript
- Key generation and verification

</pba-flex>

<aside class="notes"><p>The WASM repository provides WebAssembly versions of critical cryptographic functions used in Polkadot, including hashing algorithms (like Blake2b, SHA-256), signature schemes (like ed25519, sr25519), and other cryptographic primitives.</p>
<p>The WASM implementations offer better performance for cryptographic operations compared to pure JavaScript implementations, which is crucial for blockchain interactions. However, there are tradeoffs to consider:</p>
<p>Advantages of WASM over Pure JavaScript:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better Performance – WASM executes at near-native speeds, often 2x–10x faster than JavaScript</li>
<li>Optimized for Cryptography – Uses efficient integer operations and avoids JS floating-point limitations</li>
<li>No Garbage Collection Overhead – WASM has manual memory management, preventing GC-related slowdowns</li>
<li>Access to Optimized Libraries – Many cryptographic libraries are available in WASM</li>
<li>Better Security – Less exposure to JavaScript runtime vulnerabilities or side-channel attacks</li>
</ul>
<p>Potential Drawbacks of WASM:</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher Startup Time – WASM modules take longer to instantiate and compile than JavaScript functions</li>
<li>Complexity – Requires writing in Rust, C, or C++, then compiling to WASM, adding extra build steps</li>
<li>Larger File Sizes – WASM binaries are often larger than equivalent JS code, which can impact load times</li>
<li>Interoperability Challenges – Calling WASM from JS incurs a performance cost due to boundary overhead</li>
<li>Browser &amp; Environment Limitations – Older browsers and some restricted environments may lack full WASM support</li>
</ul>

### API Example: Basic Usage

```typescript
import { ApiPromise, WsProvider } from '@polkadot/api';

async function main() {
    // Create the API instance
    const api = await ApiPromise.create({
      provider: new WsProvider('wss://rpc.polkadot.io')
    });

    // Get chain information
    const [chain, nodeName, nodeVersion] = await Promise.all([
      api.rpc.system.chain(),
      api.rpc.system.name(),
      api.rpc.system.version()
    ]);

    console.log(`Connected to ${chain} using ${nodeName} v${nodeVersion}`);

    // Query account balance
    const ADDR = '13UVJyLnbVp9RBZYFwFGyDvVd1y27Tt8tkntv6Q7JVPhFsTB';
    const { data: balance } = await api.query.system.account(ADDR);

    console.log(`Treasury Balance: ${balance.free.toString()}`);
  }

  main().catch(console.error);</code></pre>
```

<aside class="notes"><p>This example demonstrates the basic usage of the Polkadot-JS API to connect to a node, retrieve chain information, and query an account balance. The code is straightforward and follows a promise-based pattern that will be familiar to JavaScript developers.</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### API Example: Historical Queries

```typescript
import { ApiPromise, WsProvider } from "@polkadot/api";

async function main() {
  const api = await ApiPromise.create({
    provider: new WsProvider("wss://rpc.polkadot.io"),
  });

  // Get a historical block hash
  const blockHash = await api.rpc.chain.getBlockHash(1000000);

  // Create an API instance at that block
  const apiAt = await api.at(blockHash);

  // Query historical state
  const ADDR = "13UVJyLnbVp9RBZYFwFGyDvVd1y27Tt8tkntv6Q7JVPhFsTB";
  const currentBalance = await api.query.system.account(ADDR);
  const historicalBalance = await apiAt.query.system.account(ADDR);

  console.log(`Current Balance: ${currentBalance.data.free.toString()}`);
  console.log(`Balance at Block 1,000,000: ${historicalBalance.data.free.toString()}`);
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

<aside class="notes"><p>This example demonstrates one of Polkadot-JS API&#39;s most powerful features: the ability to query historical state at any block height. This capability is essential for applications like block explorers, analytics tools, and any service that needs to understand how the chain state has changed over time.</p>
<p>The <code>api.at()</code> method creates a specialized API instance that is pinned to a specific block. All state queries made through this instance will return data as it existed at that block height, allowing for accurate historical analysis.</p>
<p>This historical state capability relies on the node having the state data available, which depends on the node&#39;s pruning settings. Archive nodes store all historical state and allow querying at any block height, while pruned nodes may only have recent state available.</p>
<p>The API handles all the complexity of tracking runtime upgrades and metadata changes, ensuring that historical queries work correctly even if the chain&#39;s structure has changed between the queried block and the current state.</p>
