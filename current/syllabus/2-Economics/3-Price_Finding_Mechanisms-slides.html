# Price Finding Mechanisms
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Introduction

- A central topic of economics is _price finding_ in markets.
- How does a buyer and a seller agree on the price of a good?
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Supply / demand for BIG markets

<img rounded style="width: 800px; margin-right: 200px;" src="./img/2.1-supply-and-demand.png" />
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Supply-demand for BIG markets

- Supply-demand model works well for _big_ markets.
- We have lots of buyers, sellers, lots of info.
- Predictable _market price_, balancing supply and demand.
- Only sensible price at which a buyer and seller can trade.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What about _difficult_ markets?

<img rounded style="width: 900px;" src="./img/2.3-auction-platform.png" />
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What about _difficult_ markets?

Today we focus on markets with few buyers or sellers,
few trades, or non-standardized goods.

<pba-flex center>

- Gov't sells radio frequencies to broadcasters.
- A painting by a famous artist trades hands.
- An oil well goes on sale with unknown amount of oil.

</pba-flex>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## A simple model

<pba-flex center>

- Selena wants to sell one item of a good.
- Two buyers, Alice and Bob.
- Each buyer has a secret _valuation_ $v_A$ and $v_B$:<br/>
  how much they are willing to pay for the item.

</pba-flex>

How does Selena _optimally_ sell the item?
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Let's assume...

<pba-flex center>

- All of Selena's income is profit.
- Alice and Bob each have random valuations between 0 and 1.
- The valuations are secret but their distribution is well-known.

</pba-flex>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Price posting

- Simplest solution: Selena posts a price $p$, sells item to first taker.
- What is her _optimal price_ $p$?
  One maximizing her _expected revenue_.
- Expected revenue: price $\times$ prob. of making a sale.
- For price $p$, prob. of making a sale is $(1-p^2)$.
- Hence her expected revenue is $p \cdot ( 1-p^2)$.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Price posting

<pba-cols>
<pba-col>

- At the optimum point, expected revenue is $\approx 0.38$.
- We will see that **an auction can do better**.

## Lesson summary

<pba-flex center>

- Auctions can be superior to posting a price.
- We discuss four important auction formats.
- How to make buyers reveal their secret valuations.
- Bid shilling.
- The revenue-equivalence theorem.
- Guides on what auction format to use in practice.

</pba-flex>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Auctions

- Alice and Bob (bidders) submit bids based on own valuations.
- Selena (auctioneer) selects winner to allocate the item to.
- The winner's payment is a function of the bids.

_An auction is a competitive game for buyers, where the seller makes the rules._
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Auction formats

<pba-flex center>

1. There are two broad classes:
   1. _Static Auctions:_ bidders submit their bids at the same time.
   1. _Dynamic Auctions:_ bidders submit bids over time.

- The difference is whether or not bidders can react to the bids of others and adjust their own.
- Static auctions are also called _sealed-bid auctions_.

</pba-flex>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Auction formats

Four auction formats we discuss today:

<pba-flex center>

- Static auctions
  - with a first-price payment rule
  - with a second-price payment rule
- Dynamic Auctions
  - with ascending price (a.k.a. English auctions)
  - with descending price (a.k.a. Dutch auction)

</pba-flex>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Second-price auction

- Why make the winner pay the second highest bid?
- Least intuitive format, but strategically simplest for bidders.
- Simply bid your valuation truthfully!
- A bidder wants to maximize their _expected profit_:
  - own valuation - price paid, in case they win
  - zero, otherwise
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Second-price auction

- **Truthful equilibrium**: a _dominant strategy_ to bid truthfully.
- **Dominant strategy**: outcome is at least as good as the outcome of any other strategy, _no matter what the other bidder bids_.

<img rounded style="width: 1300px;" src="./img/second-price-auction.svg" />
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Second-price auction

**Expected revenue**

- Selena's expected revenue is expected value of 2nd highest valuation.
- For two independent variables uniformly sampled from $[0,1]$,
  the expected value of the minimum is $1/3\approx 0.33$.
- This is not quite as good as posting a price
  (which provided expected revenue $0.38$).
  Why not?
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Reserve price

- Because the format we considered is not optimal for the auctioneer!
- The optimal auction involves a _reserve price_ $r>0$:
  - If no bid is above $r$, nobody wins.
  - If one bid is above $r$, the payment is $r$.
  - If both bids are above $r$, the payment is the second-highest bid.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Reserve price

**Fact:** Under any reserve price $r$, it is still optimal to bid truthfully, and if Selena sets $r=0.5$, her expected revenue is $\approx 0.42$, so it is better than posted price (where expected revenue was $\approx 0.38$).
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Reserve price

<img rounded style="width: 1400px;" src="./img/reserve-price.svg" />
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## English auction

Recall the rules:

<pba-flex center>

- Selena continually raises the price.
- At any price, you decide whether to stay or leave.
- If you leave, you may not return.
- If you are the last one in the auction you win<br/>
  and pay the price at which the second-to-last<br/> bidder left.

</pba-flex>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## English auction

- English auction is **strategically equivalent** to static second-price auction.
- It is a dominant strategy to stay until the price reaches one's valuation.
- The expected revenue for Selena is the also the same!
- Consequently, these two formats are also **revenue equivalent**.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Shill bidding

- Second-price and English auctions popular among theorists, not so popular among practitioners.
- One reason is that they are prone to _shill-bidding_: bidder that acts on behalf of the auctioneer to drive up the price.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## First-price auction

<pba-flex center>

- The winning bidder pays her bid.
- Other rules same as in the second-price auction; i.e.,
  - all bidders submit their bids simultaneously,
  - the highest bid wins.

</pba-flex>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## First-price auction

Bidding in the first-price auction is **not** truthful.

- Bidding truthfully can never be optimal:
  if you win, you earn nothing.
- Underbidding is strictly better, you win sometimes
  and when you do you have a positive utility.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## First-price auction

**Equilibrium strategy:** It is a _Nash equilibrium_ for each bidder to bid **half** their own valuation.

_Nash equilibrium:_ A set of strategies, one per player, where no one has an incentive to change their strategy.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## First-price auction

**Intuition:** suppose you are Alice

- If you bid 0, winning prob. is zero.
- If you bid your valuation, profit is zero.
- Hence, there is a sweet spot between 0 and your valuation
  where your expected profit is maximal.
- It turns out this is bidding half your valuation,
  at which point you and Bob each wins _half of the time_.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## First-price auction

**Expected revenue**

- Reasonable to assume each bidder bids half their valuation.
- Hence, Selena's revenue is $\frac{1}{2}\max\{v_A, v_B\}$.
- The expected value of $\max\{v_A, v_B\}$ is $2/3$.
- Hence, her expected revenue is $1/3$.

The same as in second-price auction!
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Revenue Equivalence

**Fact:** When valuations are secret and independent,
there is no reserve price, and item goes to highest bidder,
then _all auction mechanisms_ are _revenue equivalent_.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Dutch auctions

<pba-flex center>

- Selena continually lowers the price.
- As soon as a bidder accepts the price,<br/>
  they are declared winners and auction is over.
- Winner pays the price they accepted.

</pba-flex>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Dutch Auction

Recall the rules:

- The auctioneer continually lowers the price.
- At any price, you can decide whether or not to accept the price.
- If you are the first to accept the price, you win and pay the price you just accepted.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Dutch Auction

- It turns out that the Dutch auction is strategically equivalent and revenue equivalent to the static first-price auction.
- The price that you accept in the Dutch auction corresponds to the price that you'd bid in a static first-price auction.
- The tradeoffs that the bidders face are very similar: take the current price or wait a bit at the risk of another bidder accepting first.
  It is an equilibrium to wait till the price is half your valuation.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Recap

<pba-cols>
<pba-col>

**Analyzed important auction formats:**

- Static first-price auction.
- Static second-price auction.
- English auction.
- Dutch auction.

</pba-col>
<pba-col>

**Learned under standard assumptions:**

- First-price and Dutch auctions are strategy equivalent.
- Second-price and English auctions are strategy equivalent.
- All four auctions are revenue equivalent.
- Having a reserve price increases the expected revenue,
  and it beats posting a price.

## Discussion
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Independence of valuations

In our analysis, it was important to assume that
bidders' valuations are independent from one another.

_Can you think of examples where this assumption isn't sensible?_
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Independence of valuations

_Answer:_

**Sensible:** - a piece of art, where the bidders are final clients.

**Not sensible:** drilling rights to an oil well.
Bidders will have similar estimates of amount of oil,
hence valuations are highly correlated.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Common value auctions

Special scenario: there is a unique valuation of item,
but each bidder only has a private estimate of it.

In these cases, it is observed that sealed-bid auctions
tend to give higher revenue than dynamic auctions.

_Why do you think this is the case?_
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Common value auctions

_The auction may be used as a means of gathering information from other participants to triangulate a price_

_Answer_: In a dynamic auction, a bidder can use the bids of others as additional signals of the correct valuation.
If bids so far seem high, my initial estimate must be low, and vice versa, so I can adjust my personal estimate.
Hence estimates converge.

In a static auction, there is no convergence of estimates, so it is more likely that some bidders keep unusually high estimates.
As a result, there is a higher chance that the winner ends up paying more than the correct valuation.
This is known as the _winner's curse_.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Equivalence of revenues

It is observed in practice that first-price auctions lead to higher revenue than second-price auctions.

This _violates_ the equivalence of revenues, so an assumption in our analysis fails consistently.

_What do you think it is?_
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Equivalence of revenues

_Answer:_ **Risk aversion.** People prefer lower uncertainty games, even if this means lower expected profits.

_Would you rather win a million dollars with a 50% chance, or 300 thousand with a 90% chance?_

In Nash equilibrium analysis for first-price auctions, we claimed that if Bob bids half his valuation, then Alice should bid half hers, so each wins 50% of time.
But we implicitly assumed that Alice is risk neutral.
Yet she might prefer to bid more and win more often.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Front Running

Computer systems may have _front runners_: special nodes can see an incoming bid, react by creating their own bid, and make it look like their bid was created first.

If you run an auction on a system with front runners, which of the four auctions would you use?
Why?
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Front Running

_Answer:_ Meet front runner _Fred_.

In a Dutch auction, if Fred is a bidder he waits for first bidder to signal accepting the price, and Fred makes the signal first.
He's guaranteed to win with least possible price.

In second-price auction, if Fred is auctioneer he can shill bid successfully: when a highest bid arrives, he creates bid slightly under it and makes it appear as if it was created first.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Front Running

_Answer:_ Meet front runner _Fred_.

In a first-price auction, if Fred is bidder and if he can "open the seals" he can win by slightly outbidding highest bid.
(Poor data privacy, a common issue in computer systems)

Hence, it might be best to run an English auction.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Sniping

In a dynamic auction with a fixed bidding time window, _sniping_ is placing a highest bid as late as possible, so other bidders can't react and overbid you.
The practice leads to low revenue.
Particularly bad when done by a front runner (microseconds).

How to protect an auction from snipers?
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Sniping

_Answer:_ **candle auctions.**<br/>
Dynamic first-price auction with _random ending time._

<img rounded style="width: 600px;" src="./img/2.3-candle-auction-photo.jpg" />
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Sniping

_Answer:_ **candle auctions.**<br/>
Dynamic first-price auction with _random ending time._

- Similar to first-price auction
- except that ending time is unpredictable.
- At ending time, current highest bidder wins, pays own bid.
- Sniping protection: the longer you wait to bid, the higher the chances the auction ends.
