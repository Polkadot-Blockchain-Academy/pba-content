# Game Theory Basics

<aside class="notes"><p>Game theory is a field of study at the intersection of mathematics and economics.
It considers an economic system to be a game and people to be players.
According to the rules of the game, it analyzes the players&#39; best strategies and then uses this analysis to explain the observed behavior of the economic system.</p>
<p>Game theory is an interesting an powerful tool, because it&#39;s fairly simple and intuitive, yet extremely powerful to make predictions.
Hence, it&#39;s a good idea to learn game theoretical principles and keep them in the back of your mind when designing economic systems.</p>

## What is Game Theory?

> Game theory studies strategic situations where the outcome for each participant or 'player' depends on the actions of all others. It formulates models to represent these scenarios and predicts the most likely or optimal outcomes.

## Game Theory in Web3

In the context of blockchains, game theoretic reasoning is used for <span style="font-style: italic;">modelling</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">understanding</span>.

## Types of games

Game theory distinguishes between:

<ul>
<li class="fragment">static & dynamic games</li>
<li class="fragment">complete & incomplete information games</li>
</ul>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Static and Dynamic Games

|                  | Static Game                                                          | Dynamic Game                                                                                           |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Definition       | All players take their actions at the same time                      | Players move sequentially and possibly multiple times, (at least partially) observing previous actions |
| Simple Example   | Rock-Paper-Scissors                                                  | Tic-Tac-Toe                                                                                            |
| Economic Example | Sealed-bid auction.                                                  | English Auction.                                                                                       |
|                  | All bidders submit their bids simultaneously (in a sealed envelope). | Auctioneer publicly raises price if at least one bidder accepts the price.                             |
| Representation   | Payoff Matrix                                                        | Decision Tree                                                                                          |

## Completeness of Information in Games

|                       | Game of Complete Information                          | Game of Incomplete Information                             |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Information available | All information relevant to decision-making is known. | Not all information relevant to decision-making is known.  |
| Simple Example        | Chess                                                 | Poker                                                      |
| Economic Example      | Sealed auction for seized Bitcoin.                    | Used-car market: the resale value of a used car is opaque. |

### Three firms want to hire an engineer...

<pba-col>

- The engineer brings added value to each firm of 300,000 USD per year.
- The payoff of the firm is known by everyone to be 300,000 USD minus the salary.
- The payoff to the engineer is salary minus cost of working, which is known to everyone.
- All firms make a salary offer at the same time.

1.  Is this game static or dynamic?
    What would need to change in the description of the game such that it would fall in the other category?

## Game 1: Guessing Game

- We divide the classroom into three groups and play a guessing game.
- The budget for this game is: $320.
- The game is simple: each player enters a number from 1 to 100.
- The player who guessed closest to 2/3 of the average number wins.
- You can only choose integer values.
- If multiple people win, the payoff is split equally.
- The game is repeated for ten rounds.

## Game 2: Prisoner's Dilemma

- You play a Prisoner's Dilemma (groups of 2) over 10 rounds.
- You will be randomly matched to another student in the class.
- Budget for this game: $670
- You have the option to chat between rounds.
- Important: Keep the chat civil and do not reveal any identifying information about yourself.
- We will read the chat.

## Repeated Prisonner's Dilemma

<ul>
    <li class="fragment">Prof. Robert Axelrod held a tournament in the 1980s to find out which computer program ("strategy") would perform best against others.</li>
    <li class="fragment">In the first tournament, 14 strategies were submitted by leading Game Theorists and others in the field.</li>
    <li class="fragment">The game would be repeated 200 times.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Each strategy would play against every other strategy and against itself.</li>
</ul>

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Based on <a href="https://ve42.co/Axelrod1980a">https://ve42.co/Axelrod1980a</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mScpHTIi-kM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mScpHTIi-kM</a></li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Repeated Prisonner's Dilemma

<ul>
    Some famous strategies were:
    <li class="fragment">Being sneaky: Cooperate but smuggle in some defections.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Grim trigger: Always cooperate but retaliate and defect forever, if the other defect once.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Tit-For-Tat: Start with cooperate and copy the opponent's strategy of the last round.</li>
</ul>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Repeated Prisonner's Dilemma

<ul>
    <li class="fragment">Tit-for-Tat was the best-performing strategy.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Prof. Axelrod was able to deduce four main aspects of well-performing strategies:
        <ul>
            <li class="fragment">First: Be nice (do not defect first).</li>
            <li class="fragment">Second: Be forgiving (retaliate but do not hold a grudge).</li>
            <li class="fragment">Third: Be retaliatory (strike back).</li>
            <li class="fragment">Fourth: Be clear (signal a simple strategy so the other knows who they are playing against).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>This was rather big surprise, especially since dominant strategy is being nasty.</li>
<li>A lot of it is what we can observe in today&#39;s politics.</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Repeated Prisonner's Dilemma

<ul>
    <li class="fragment">There is no single best strategy.</li>
    <li class="fragment">It always depends on who you are playing against.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Simulations in a later study show that a cluster of tit-for-tat players within a defecting population can grow and overtake defecting types.</li>

## Game 3: Public Good Game

- We will play a public good game as presented in the lesson.
- Budget for this game: $670
- Groups of 4 over 10 periods.
- Points in the project is multiplied by factor $1.6$.
- With one additional mechanism: After each round each player sees the contributions of the other players and can decide to deduct points from them (at own costs).
