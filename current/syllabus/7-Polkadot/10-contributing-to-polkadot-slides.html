- The Polkadot Fellowship reviews and provides feedback to the RFCs.
- RFC approval is done on-chain either by the fellowship or through public referendum.
- The Polkadot Fellowship also stewards forward approved RFCs.

## Dan I

<!-- TO DO columns should be better aligned -->

<span style="font-size:0.75em;">

<pba-flex center>



_The requirements (condensed) to become a Dan I member of the Polkadot Fellowship are:_

</span>

</br>

- Three clear examples of a modest but substantial contribution to protocol development.
- Actively been involved in the design of a component deployed to the network.
- Substantially assisted in the analysis, or authoring of formalisation or implementation of a protocol component.
- Should be able to list all key goals, principles and tenets of Polkadot’s overall philosophy.

</pba-flex>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Dan I Contributions


</br>

<pba-flex center>


Possible examples of a “modest but substantial contribution” may be:

</br>

- identifying and correcting a non-trivial issue in protocol code or formalisation;
- being available and playing a crucial operational role for a network fix;
- proposing a reasonable and non-trivial protocol innovation; or
- doing a valuable, innovative and insightful refactoring or simplification.

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Fellowship Clarity

</br>

- The Fellowship is a very new, and still developing organization.
- The Fellowship offers technical influence over the Polkadot Network and a regular income.
- It is attempting to provide human needs of consistent / regular income from a resilient decentralized source.
- The barrier to entry is intentionally _very high._
- It is NOT a requirement to contribute to the Polkadot SDK or broader ecosystem.
- It is NOT the path for everyone, even not necessarily for all core developers. 
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## My recommended path to becoming a fellow…

</br>

- Join a team in the Polkadot (or broader) ecosystem aligned with the values of the fellowship.
- Work with them to split your time between their work and core contributions to the Polkadot SDK.
  - A team aligned with the values of the fellowship should be elated to have a fellow on their team.
- Navigate your way to Dan III, a clear milestone to receive a full-time living salary for your work.
  - ~3 years to learn, grow, and develop.
- If you want, transition to becoming a full time decentralized contributor to Polkadot.

## Issues / Ideas

<!-- original slides had 90 and -90 degree "ideas"/"issues" text around a box-->
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
#### **Before you can contribute** you need to find an issue.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## A common mistake…

</br>

- Don’t come to the Polkadot SDK with brand new features that you want to implement.
- Polkadot is already a huge codebase, and does not want to maintain more code.
- As a new contributor in the ecosystem, you don’t necessarily have the context and knowledge to best understand what needs to be done, and how to integrate new features into the repo.
- The best way to start becoming an expert at Polkadot SDK (or any open source repo) is to pick up existing issues created by experts who can also mentor you.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Find the right issues

</br>


_Not all issues are created equal:_

- _Difficulty:_ What level of Rust and/or Substrate expertise do you need to have to complete the issue?
- _Sensitivity:_ What parts of the codebase does the issue touch, and how could that potentially affect the network?
- _Clarity:_ How well understood is the solution to the issue?
- _Urgency:_ How quickly does this PR need to be completed?

### An Issue that Rust Compiler Can Entirely Check

<img rounded style="width: 1000px" src="assets/Contributing/example2.png" />

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Become a subject expert and code owner

</br>

- Training new open source contributors is very much a long term investment mindset.
- You are more likely to find issues to work on and people to mentor you if you create a focus area for your contributions.
- If you can become an expert in a topic area, you will be able to develop deeper and more relevant skills, and be able to transfer those skills to other topic areas.

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Keep conversations in public.

</br>

- The urge is to always try to open a direct message to quickly discuss and resolve questions.
- Culture for Polkadot is: global and async.
- Long form messages force writers to think more deeply about what is being asked and answered.
- Use DMs to ping for attention, but bring important conversations and information to the Forum, GitHub, and other public spaces.
  - You will be surprised how many lurkers use these conversations to educate themselves.

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">### Pull Requests & Reviews
<!-- original slides had 90 and -90 degree Pull requests and reviews text around a box-->

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Breakdown Large PRs

</br>

A large PR is the easiest way to get repository owners to place your code at the bottom of their “TODO” stack. Split up large PRs into multiple parts!

- Take advantage of the Rust compiler.
  - Create a PR with just low sensitivity type changes
  - Sensitive logical changes in another PR which should be more compact to review.
  - Chain their dependencies on each other.
- Where you are refactoring many components (like pallets), do them one at a time where possible.

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Write Tests!

<img rounded style="float:right;  padding-left:20px" src="assets/Contributing/boyscoutrule.png" />


- The best way for a reviewer to sanity check your work is to read and understand your tests, and verify it passes.
    - You will be surprised how even the most trivial changes can (and should) include a test!
- Try to get additional test scenarios from the original issue creator, to ensure your solution aligns with their vision of the problem.
- Write additional tests to cement your understanding of existing code, and add additional code coverage.

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Write Docs!

</br>

- Code always needs to be contextualized into what problem it is trying to solve and how it is choosing to solve that problem.
- Documentation in the code should allow a reader to answer what the intention of the code is.
- Documentation in the PR should guide the reviewer through the PR, highlighting the key areas of importance and the crux of the changes.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Review Your Own PR

</br>

- Once you have a final PR open, and ready for review, go through and review your own PR.
- Leave comments on code that you might want to highlight for other reviewers.
    - For example sensitive changes that need extra scrutiny.
- Catch any dead code, leftover comments, todos, formatting problems, and other low hanging fruit.
    - As a reviewer, it is pretty discouraging to see the PR is not in great shape to be merged when reviewing it.
