# Agile Coretime

<aside class="notes"><p>Today we&#39;ll be tackling Agile Coretime. How many people heard about it?
I often see people confused about what coretime truly is, when it comes and what &quot;feature&quot; it is exactly.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# Agile Coretime

## Core Features

- Bulk Coretime Auctions
- On-Demand Coretime
- Coretime Interlacing
- Elastic Scaling
- Renewals
- Coretime Markets

<aside class="notes"><p>In reality agile coretime is a collection of features that all interact with each other to overhaul the way Polkadot manages
and exposes it&#39;s most important resources, execution cores. Essentially it&#39;s an alternative scheduling mechanism.</p>

<aside class="notes"><p>The coretime I will be presenting today is still in development. The blueprint for it was outlined in the Fellowship RFC 1 and 5 (links in notes) and it is mostly staying true to it but implementation details can be different here and there. Nevertheless the spirit will remain unchanged.</p>

# The Product of Polkadot

**What is the product?**

<aside class="notes"><p>First let’s zoom out and look at the Polkadot protocol. What does it actually produce? And I don’t mean the individual parachains but the core protocol (mostly living on the relay chain) itself.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# The Product of Polkadot

## Blockspace

<img style="width: 500px" src="./assets/coretime/blockspace.png"/>

<aside class="notes"><p>It is blockspace! Blockspace is the data that we guarantee consensus on and provide availability for. And not only is it blockspace, it is high quality blockspace.
The quality is referring to how confidence in it being secure and live, it needs to be durable system that stood the test of time.</p>

## Sharding

<img style="width: 500px" src="./assets/coretime/polkadot-architecture.svg"/>

Sharding allows us to produce more blockspace with the same resources

<aside class="notes"><p>And because Polkadot is effectively sharded it can validate in parallel producing plenty of blockspace.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# The Product of Polkadot

## Blockspace vs Coretime

They are two sides of the same coin. Execution cores enable sharding and they create the highly valuable high quality blockspace.

> (Secure) blockspace is the resource Polkadot provides, which is measured in and allocated through coretime.

<aside class="notes"><p>There are some caveats to it, but generally coretime and blockspace are very highly coupled in Polkadot. The more coretime you have the more blockspace you gain out of it.
Coretime is presenting a more execution based perspective and blockspace paints it in a data oriented way.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# The Product of Polkadot

## Pricing blockspace

<img style="width: 300px" src="./assets/coretime/tokens.png"/>

Blockspace needs to be priced and distributed to those that need it.

<aside class="notes"><p>But for this blockspace to be utilized we need to find appropriate clients and sell it to them. Generally sovereign and usually commercial parachains were the main consumers of blockspace so in what form was it sold and how were they acquiring it?.</p>

Lease gave you the right to register your parachain and fully occupy a specific core.

A core is able to validate a single block every 6s and leases were practically always 2 years.

<aside class="notes"><p>This design was very strictly defining the amount and frequency of the blockspace being sold.

## Slot Auctions

Leases are acquired on candle auction called Slot Auctions

<aside class="notes"><p>So now we know what is being sold so how was it sold? Every once in a while when an execution core was unscheduled it was being put up to a slot auction. A slot auction aimed to find a parachain that would occupy it for the next two years. The auction was a candle auction for those that remember how they work. Anyone wants to quickly remind us?</p>

## Slot Auctions

<img  src="./assets/coretime/slot_auctions.png"/>

<aside class="notes"><p>The auctions required huge amounts of DOT tokens. Often millions of dollars. So to allow amazing but poorly funded teams to flourish a crowd loan system was created. It allowed normal token holders to pool their dot together and lend them to the team. Those tokens were then used to secure a bid in the auction. Of course the token holders were not doing it for free. They were expecting some rewards in return coming from the team behind the project.</p>

What was the cost?

Why is Polkadot deprecating slot auctions and leases?

<aside class="notes"><p>Today things are changing but to understand why let’s look at some of the pain points of the original system.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# Parachain Leases

## Issues

- Most parachains didn't fully fill up their blocks (wasted blockspace)
- ...
- ...

<aside class="notes"><p>Leases were very inflexible and in reality not many blockchains needed as much as a huge block every 6s. There was literally too much throughput for most use cases! But you still had to purchase the whole thing giving you blocks every 6s so the rest was waste</p>

# Parachain Leases

- Lease Auctions and Crowd Loans were huge endeavors causing major overhead

<aside class="notes"><p>And finally slot auctions were a noticeable burden for the teams. Every two years they had to significantly plan around them to garner support, funds, promise a reward scheme for the crowd loans and figure out strategically how to bid at the auctions.</p>

# Agile Coretime Mission

- Waste less blockspace
- Allow for higher max throughout

</aside></script></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# Bulk Auctions

<aside class="notes"><p>We&#39;ll start with a method that should be the most familiar and in fact very similar to the old slot auctions - bulk auctions.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# Bulk Auctions

## What is being sold?

Parablock every 6s for 28 days

<img  src="./assets/coretime/para.svg"/>

# Bulk Auctions

## What method?

Dutch Auctions

<img style="width: 600px" src="./assets/coretime/dutch.jpeg"/>

<aside class="notes"><p>And to sell all of that we are using the classic dutch auctions. In that case the price decreases over the span
of weeks so it&#39;s not as rapid as the traditional ones, but the principle remains.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# Bulk Auctions

## Where do the funds go?

Price paid will no longer be returned after the "lease" is over. This time the cost is paid upfront instead of
implicitly through the opportunity cost of locking your funds like in crowd loans.

<aside class="notes"><p>CUrrent dominant strategy agreed on by the community is to burn the coretime profits. TLDR why is that volatile flows to the treasure are not healthy and introduce complex game theoretical attacks.

# Bulk Auctions

## Pricing

Price adapter cycle:

- System starts at target price X
- Dutch auction initiate with 10X (much more then we expect to sell it for)
- Price drops to X over a week
- Price drops to 10% of X over the next week which is the minimum
- The core sold at the lowest price (or minimum price if no sales) becomes new target price

<aside class="notes"><p>Pricing could be it&#39;s own lecture but to keep it brief. The system starts with some default price X. The dutch auctions enters what we call a leadin period, a period where the price will steeply decrease from 10x to x over a week and then from x to x/10 over the next week. Then it&#39;s just a matter of setting a new target price for the next sale. Sales happen every 28 days.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# Bulk Auctions

## Pricing

<img style="width: 500px" src="./assets/coretime/bulk_pricing.png"/>

<aside class="notes"><p>This very roughly approximates an exponential decay curve with three linear functions. We are actually in discussions to make it smooth and make the potential scope of prices even wider.</p>

# Bulk Auctions

## Leases repackaged?

<img style="width: 500px" src="./assets/coretime/spider.jpg"/>

<aside class="notes"><p>Although despite this difference at this point you might be asking, hey, this is nearly exactly the same as the method
before. How is that even new or better? Because that bulk you buy carries a lot more information and flexibility than previous leases.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# Bulk Auctions

## Coretime Regions

Leases when bought were instantly fixed and unchangeable.

Coretime regions are NFTs that are transferrable and programmable\*.

<aside class="notes"><p>Previously to exchange leases teams had to go through governance and create a referendum. This time coretime regions can easily be reassigned to a different parachain.
This allows interested parties to buy some off the auction and sell it off for a fixed price to others. Teams that don&#39;t want to deal with auctions can
source it through those brokers. We&#39;ll talk about them more soon but region reassignment is just the first step towards coretime programmability. So
let&#39;s now look at interlacing.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# Interlacing

<aside class="notes"><p>This is the truly exciting stuff. That was fully impossible before.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# Interlacing

<img style="width: 700px" src="./assets/coretime/no_interlacing.svg"/>

<aside class="notes"><p>So with no interlacing someone could utilize bulk like this. Just naively put out a block every 6s.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# Interlacing

Interlacing two or more different parachains means they can be co-scheduled onto the same execution core.

<aside class="notes"><p>I hope the name this time around is actually pretty self-descriptive. Interlacing allows to weave two or more different parachains on the
same core. They might be taking turns or using any other arbitrary co-scheduling pattern.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# Interlacing

## Example

<img style="width: 700px" src="./assets/coretime/interlacing.svg"/>

<aside class="notes"><p>A concrete example of that would be two parachains coscheduled onto the same core. They would take turns in producing blocks so each on will effectively have a 12s block time.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# Interlacing

## Mask Programmability

Interlacing is achieve through manipulating the coretime region bit masks.

Freshly bought coretime region from the bulk auction would be fully scheduled (complete):

Projects like Moonbeam and soon Mythical are definitely capable of fully utilizing a single core.

<aside class="notes"><p>Mythical is coming over to Polkadot with a pretty mature fanbase and a few already successful commercial products. And one big reason why the chose Polkadot is because they can build here what they could not in other decentralised chains, because of our superb scalability.

## Value of Long-Term Stability

Business don't like uncertainty. They want to know they can operate for a long time and budget for their expenses.

If every spike on the graph endangers your business you will build it elsewhere.

<aside class="notes"><p>See that spike around 2021? Gas fees went from 20-30 to 700. Imagine you suddenly can&#39;t run your business because the gas is too high. That&#39;s a no-go for any serious business. So long-term stability is crucial for any business.</p>

# Renewals

## Price Stability Guarantee

Renewals are a special sort of treatment for teams that value long-term stability extremely highly.

If you don't interlace or split your coretime region and you fully utilize it then you can renew it for the same price you bought it for + small percentage (4% currently).

# Renewals

## Price Stability Guarantee

Renewals can be made in the interlude phase before the actual bulk auction starts:

<aside class="notes"><p>Making a renewal increases your costs but it gives a solid cap for how much they can increase allowing you to budget well into the future. Additionally if the target price in the market drops heavily the renewal price can also be lowered, but the growth is always capped.</p>

## Agile Coretime Combinations

- On-Demand cores work for Elastic Scaling allowing for quick scaling up and down based on demand
- Bulk Auctions + On-Demand -> Coretime Regions can be sold to the On-Demand Core Pool to extend its size which can generate profit for the seller

# The Coretime Chain

Bulk Auctions and vast majority of the low level interfaces live not on the relay chain but a brand new Coretime Broker Chain
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# Current State of Coretime

- Bulk Auctions are live in Kusama (including renewals)
- 2 cores were already sold last month in Kusama using Lastic
- On-Demand Coretime is available on testes for experimentation and will soon be ready to go
- Elastic Scaling is tested internally for now but the MVP is nearing completion
- Interlacing is functional in Kusama but some bugs are still getting ironed out
