## Smart Contracts VS Pallets

<div class="flex-container">
<div class="left" style="font-size: smaller">

Additional layer of logic on top of a blockchain’s existing core logic.

- There are three safeguards in place to make Smart Contracts work properly and securely.
  - _Predefined Fees_: Ensure that contract developers are charged for computation and storage defined at runtime level.
  - _Sandbox_: Can't modify core blockchain storage or the storage of other contracts directly.
  - _Revert_: Reverting transactions when they fail so no state is updated when things go wrong.

In contrast, pallets are compiled together to create the base runtime of a parachain.
Runtime development has no safeguards against malicious actors and inexperienced developers.

</div>
</div>

<aside class="notes"><p>Smart contracts add an additional layer of logic on top of a blockchain’s existing core logic.
One benefit of this structure is that anyone can build onto and recreate an existing smart contract and its runtime logic to create a modified version of a given code or protocol.
A particularly important feature to smart contracts is the way they perform cross-contract calling to delegate and message other contracts.
Anyone is capable of publishing smart contracts onto existing blockchains, including malicious actors and inexperienced developers.
However, there are a number of safeguards for this.</p>
<p>In contrast, pallets are compiled together to create the base runtime of a parachain.
Runtime development has no safeguards against malicious actors and inexperienced developers.
You have full control of the underlying logic that each node on your network will run.
You have full access to each and every storage item across all of your modules, which you can modify and control.
You can even brick your chain with incorrect logic or poor error handling.</p>
<p>Pallets also provide granular control of transaction (TX) fees, allowing developers to be able to make certain, or all, TXs free.
This implementation can get as specific as only charging fees when certain TX conditions are met.</p>
<p>All of this control provided by Substrate pallets creates a double-edged sword.
More control in “bricking” or blocking your own chains means more room for errors, compared to smart contracts.</p>

## Smart Contracts Pallets

Substrate provides different Smart Contracts' options.

- Pallet Contracts - Wasm execution environment
- Frontier - EVM execution environment

## Frontier

Frontier provides an Ethereum compatibility layer for Substrate.<br/>
It has two components that can be activated separately.

<aside class="notes"><p><strong>Pallet EVM</strong>: This is the pallet that enables functionality of running EVM contracts.
Existing EVM code can be used from there, using addresses and values mapped directly to Substrate.</p>
<p><strong>Pallet Ethereum</strong>: The pallet, combined with the RPC module, enables Ethereum block emulation, validates Ethereum-encoded transactions, and allows existing dapps to be deployed on a Substrate blockchain with minimal modifications.</p>
<p>A Web3 JS RPC call from a DApp or existing Ethereum developer tool, such as Truffle, is received by a Frontier node.
The node will have both Web3 RPCs and Substrate RPCs available, which means that you can use Ethereum or Substrate tools when interacting with a Frontier node.
These RPC calls are handled by associated Substrate runtime functions.
The Substrate runtime checks signatures and handles any extrinsics.
Smart contract calls are ultimately passed to the EVM to execute the state transitions.</p>

- Ethereum uses a 160-bit hex string as its public address.
- On Substrate, we call this format H160, for 160-bit hash.
- The EVM environment has its own balance called the EVM deposit, which can be withdrawn by Substrate native accounts.

<aside class="notes"><p>Ethereum uses a 160-bit hex string as its public address, which users can send and receive transactions.
On Substrate, we call this format H160, for 160-bit hash.
For a blockchain to be Ethereum-compatible, they must use H160 accounts, as that is the only account format that EVM and all tools within the Ethereum ecosystem will recognize.
This rule applies to Substrate chains with the EVM pallet as well.</p>
<p>The EVM environment has its own balance called the EVM deposit, which can be withdrawn by Substrate native accounts.
A native Substrate SS58 address can be converted to an H160 address that is mapped to an EVM deposit, and an EVM H160 address can be converted to an SS58 address.
This allows the accounts to transfer tokens from the native balance to an EVM balance, and vice versa.
However, this is a lossy conversion, so you cannot convert an SS58 to H160 and back to the same SS58 address.
Furthermore, you can only sign transactions within the environment that the account was created.
So for example, through normal ways, you cannot sign an EVM transaction with a native account or the other way around.</p>

From a contract&#39;s perspective, this is just a single command like an opcode.
These contracts are implemented as a native implementation.</p>
<p>The EVM environment works on top of Substrate.
This means that the block height of the EVM sandbox will depend on the host Substrate network and the host Substrate network will be able to access the EVM state, but the EVM sandbox will not be able to access or mutate the host Substrate network’s state through normal means.
Substrate state transition from EVM can only be achieved via custom EVM precompiled contracts.</p>

- Stack-based virtual machine.
- Compilation of high-level languages like C/C++ and Rust.
- Fast, efficient, and safe, with near-native performance.
- WebAssembly has only four primitive types: i32, i64, f32 and f64.

<aside class="notes"><p>The WebAssembly (Wasm) architecture is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine.
It is designed as a portable target for compilation of high-level languages like C/C++ and Rust.
Wasm is designed to be fast, efficient, and safe, with near-native performance and no need for plugins or additional downloads.
Wasm code is written in a low-level assembly-like language, and is then compiled into a binary format that can be executed on the web.
The architecture is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing developers to create custom tools and libraries to make web applications more powerful and interactive.</p>
<p>The WebAssembly binary is a sequence of instructions that are executed on a stack-based machine.
Simple instructions perform operations on data; they consume their operands from the stack and produce a result that is placed on the stack.
Control instructions alter the control flow of the code.
A program can call functions directly or indirectly through a function table.</p>

## Stack-based Virtual Machine

<img rounded style="width: 1000px;" src="../../assets/img/6-FRAME/6.5-Smart_Contracts/wasm/Stack_1.png" />

We want to add 2 numbers.

<aside class="notes"><p>Let’s start with a trivial example: suppose your program needs to add two numbers.
To do that in a stack VM, the program will push the first number to the stack, push the second and then execute some form of the special instruction add, that will pop the first two elements of the stack and replace them with their sum.
Let’s see it step by step:</p>

I) We start by pushing the first element to the stack.

<aside class="notes"><p>The SP is the stack pointer, which refers to the head of the stack.
The IP is the instruction pointer, which points to the address of the current instruction to execute.
Let’s now execute the first instruction:</p>

II) We push the second element to the stack.

<aside class="notes"><p>You can see that the stack now contains 1 and that the instruction pointer has been moved to the next instruction.
Let’s now simulate the second instruction:</p>

III) Finally we can execute the add instruction.

The head of the stack and the previous element have been popped and replaced with their sum.</p>

#### Wasm Architecture

<img rounded style="width: 1400px;" src="../../assets/img/6-FRAME/6.5-Smart_Contracts/wasm/WebAssembly-high-level-architecture.png" />

<aside class="notes"><p>WebAssembly has only four primitive types: i32, i64, f32 and f64.
The first two represent integers with 32 and 64 bits respectively, whereas the last two denote 32 and 64-bit floating-point data.
Global variables, local variables, and return addresses are managed in the stack.
All non-scalar types, such as strings, arrays, and other buffers, must be stored in linear memory, which is a contiguous, untyped, byte-addressable array, multiple of 64Kib.
A program can load/store values from/to linear memory at any byte address.
A trap occurs if an access is not within the bounds of the current memory size.</p>
