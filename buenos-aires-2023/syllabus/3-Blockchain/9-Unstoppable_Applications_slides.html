# Unstoppable Applications

<aside class="notes"><p>Much like tokenomic design, that is a large component in unstoppable apps that incorporate cryptocurrency or other motivating factors, this lesson is far far too short to give you all the tools and techniques to make a robust DApp design.</p>
<p>Instead we strive to highlight the problem space we face and some classes of solutions to them.</p>

## Motivation

So far, we have discussed state machines and consensus... in _isolation_.

Does the _contexts in which they operate within_ matter?

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>So far <em>mostly</em> on simplified, idealized systems.<ul>
<li>&quot;Black boxes&quot; of cryptography</li>
<li>Rational actors and assumed complete models of behavior in economics</li>
<li>Blockchains as an &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolated_system">isolated system</a>&quot; of sorts - external systems <em>cannot</em> be reasoned about in the same way...
We will talk about the Oracle Problem.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In <em>practice</em> there are far more <a href="#%F0%9F%99%88-unknown-unknowns">&quot;unknown unknowns&quot;</a> and &quot;black swan&quot; behavior.
More to come on that in this lesson.</li>

However, every transaction must be included by an authority.

If no authority will include a user's transaction, they do not have _permissionless_ access.

_If any authority (author) decides not to censor, it **may** be included._

<aside class="notes"><p>Most present systems have no mechanism to penalize censorship, and a much harder problem can be the ability to discover this is happening on the network at all, depending on the actors involved.</p>

## Maximal Extractable Value (MEV)

A measure of the value that block authors can extract based on their knowledge of pending transactions and ability to order them.

## Flashbots 😈

- **Flashbots Auction**: a marketplace for transaction ordering including the Flashbots Relay and MEV-Geth.
- **MEV-Boost**: an out-of-protocol implementation of proposer-builder separation (PBS) for proof-of-stake Ethereum.
- **Flashbots Protect**: an rpc endpoint that anyone can use for protection from frontrunning and failed transactions.
- **Flashbots Data**: tools and dashboards to improve the transparency of MEV activity on Ethereum and the Flashbots Auction.

## Final Thoughts

- Complexity generally increases the risks of failures, but we should not fear it.<br/>
  $~~~$_Hypothesis: this \_usually_ makes systems more brittle.\_
- Observable behavior trumps models and theory.<br/>
  $~~~$_Complex systems are not intuitive and may show your assumptions and models are wrong!_
- This lesson was a _start_ down holes...
  $~~~$_We encourage you to keep diving deeper!_

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Risks and unknown unknowns increase exponentially so in many cases.</li>
<li>Examples of observables in things like MEV OFAC dominance and Babe fallback dominance etc.</li>
<li>Looking forward to explore the great unknown horizons in Web3 together!</li>

## Unstoppable Code

> It seizes power from dominate forms of power: governments, corporations, states, associations, cultures, religions.
> It seizes power, from these big things and gives it to little people.
> And sooner or later, the people who are losing their undeserved, abusively applied power will start to fight back.
> And at that point, we will start to find out how unstoppable our code is.<br/><br/>

## Can't vs. Won't

> The moment you go over the the line from "can't to won't, what started as an ability becomes a responsibility.
