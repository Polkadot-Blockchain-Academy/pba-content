# XCM in Polkadot
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## _At the end of this lecture, you will be able to:_

<pba-flex center>

- Understand the configuration of the Rococo chain
- Send real-world messages between parachain A <-> Rococo
- Identify potential errors on XCM messages
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## ü§î Considerations

- There should be no trust assumption between chains unless explicitly requested.
- We cannot assume chains will not act maliciously
- Spamming XCM messages creates a DoS problem
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## üõ†Ô∏è Rococo Configuration

- Barriers
- Teleport filtering
- Trusted reserves
- Asset transactors
- Fee payment
- Proper XCM Instruction Weighting
- Location to Account/FRAME Origin conversions

<aside class="notes"><p>From now on, we will use the Rococo runtime as a reference.
Rococo is a testnet for
Polkadot and Kusama that we will use in to test our XCM messages.
Most of the Rococo configuration
is identical to that in Polkadot.</p>

## üöß XCM `Barrier` in Rococo

```rust
/// The barriers one of which must be passed for an XCM message to be executed.
pub type Barrier = (
  // Weight that is paid for may be consumed.
  TakeWeightCredit,
  // If the message is one that immediately attempts to pay for execution, then allow it.
  AllowTopLevelPaidExecutionFrom<Everything>,
  // Messages coming from system parachains need not pay for execution.
  AllowUnpaidExecutionFrom<IsChildSystemParachain<ParaId>>,
  // Expected responses are OK.
  AllowKnownQueryResponses<XcmPallet>,
  // Subscriptions for version tracking are OK.
  AllowSubscriptionsFrom<Everything>,
);
```
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## üöß XCM `Barrier in Rococo

- `TakeWeightCredit` and `AllowTopLevelPaidExecutionFrom` are used to prevent spamming for local/remote XCM execution.
- `AllowUnpaidExecutionFrom` lets a system parachain have free execution in the relay.
- `AllowKnownQueryResponses` and `AllowSubscriptionsFrom`, as we know already, are mostly used for versioning.

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Child system parachains are parachains that contain core polkadot features, and they will get a paraId of less than 1000.
They are allocated by Polkadot governance and get free execution.</li>
<li><code>AllowKnownQueryResponses</code> will check pallet-xcm storage to know whether the response is expected. -<code>AllowSubscriptionsFrom</code> determines that any origin is able to subscribe for version changes.</li>

## ü§ù Trusted teleporters in Rococo

- Teleporting involves trust between chains.
- 1000 (Statemint) and 1001 (Contracts) and 1002 (Encointer) are allowed to teleport tokens represented by the **Here**
- **Here** represents the relay token

```rust
impl xcm_executor::Config for XcmConfig {

  type IsTeleporter = TrustedTeleporters;
  /* snip */

```

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Statemine, Rococo and Encointer are able to teleport the relay chain token</li>

</aside></script></section></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## üí±Trusted reserves in Rococo

- Rococo does not recognize any chain as reserve
- Rococo prevents reception of any **ReserveAssetDeposited** message

```rust
impl xcm_executor::Config for XcmConfig {

  type IsReserve = ();
  /* snip */

```

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Trusting other parachains (e.g., common good parachains) to be reserves of the relay native token would cause rare situations with the total issuance.
For instance, users could drain reserves of the sovereign account with teleported funds.</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## üìÅ `LocationToAccountId` in Rococo

- Conversion between a multilocation to an AccountId is a key component to withdraw/deposit assets and issue `Transact` operations.
- Parachain origins will be converted to their corresponding sovereign account.
- Local 32 byte origins will be converted to a 32 byte defined AccountId.

```rust
pub type LocationConverter = (
  // We can convert a child parachain using the standard `AccountId` conversion.
  ChildParachainConvertsVia<ParaId, AccountId>,
  // We can directly alias an `AccountId32` into a local account.
  AccountId32Aliases<RococoNetwork, AccountId>,
);
```

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Any other origin that is not a parachain origin or a local 32 byte account origin will not be convertible to an accountId.</li>
<li>Question class what happens if a message coming from a parachain starts with <code>DescendOrigin</code>?
XcmV2 will reject it at the barrier level (Since <strong><em>AllowTopLevelPaidExecutionFrom</em></strong> expects the first instruction to be one of <strong><em>ReceiveTeleportedAsset</em></strong> , <strong><em>WithdrawAsset</em></strong> , <strong><em>ReserveAssetDeposited</em></strong> or <strong><em>ClaimAsset</em></strong> - XcmV3 will pass the barrier as <strong><em>AllowTopLevelPaidExecutionFrom</em></strong> is inside <strong><em>WithComputedOrigin</em></strong>.</li>

## ü™ô `asset-transactors` in Rococo

- Single asset-transactor in Rococo
- Asset-transactor is matching the **Here** multilocation id to the Currency defined in **Balances**, which refers to **_pallet-balances_**
- Essentially, this is configuring XCM such that the native token (DOT) is associated with the multilocation **Here**.

<aside class="notes"><ul>

## üìç`origin-converter` in Rococo

- Defines ways in which we can convert a multilocation to a dispatch origin, typically used by the `Transact` instruction:
- Child parachain origins are converted to signed origins through **_LocationConverter_** (`OriginKind == Sovereign`).
- Child parachains can also be converted to native parachain origins (`OriginKind == Native`).
- Local 32 byte origins are converted to signed 32 byte origins (`OriginKind == Native`).

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>There exists the concept of a &quot;parachain dispatch origin&quot; which is used for very specific functions (like, e.g., opening a channel with another chain).

## üîß `WeightTrader` in Rococo

- Weight is converted to fee with the **_WeightToFee_** type.
- The asset in which we charge for fee is **_RocLocation_**.
  This means we can only pay for xcm execution in the **native currency**
- Fees will go to the block author thanks to **_ToAuthor_**

```rust
impl xcm_executor::Config for XcmConfig {
  /* snip */
  type Trader = UsingComponents<

# Debugging XCM
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## üßê Debugging XCM message failures

Involves knowledge of the chain XCM configuration!

Common steps to debug:

1. Identify what the error means which will help you identify the context in which the error happened.
1. Look in the xcm codebase to check where this error might have been thrown.
   Was it thrown in the barrier?
   Or in any specific instruction?
1. Retrieve the failed received XCM.
1. Check the chain XCM configuration to verify what could have failed.
</script></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Identifying the error kind

Look at the `ump.ExecutedUpward` event:

<img rounded style="width: 800px;" src="../../../assets/img/7-XCM/failed-ump.png" alt="Ump failure" />
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Identifying the error kind

- `UntrustedReserveLocation`: a `ReserveAssetDeposited` was received from a location we don't trust as reserve.
- `UntrustedTeleportLocation`: a `ReceiveTeleportedAsset` was received from a location we don't trust as teleporter.
- `AssetNotFound`: the asset to be withdrawn/deposited is not handled by the asset transactor.
  Usually happens when the multilocation representing an asset does not match to those handled by the chain.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Identifying the error kind

- `FailedToTransactAsset`: the withdraw/deposit of the asset cannot be processed, typically it's because the account does not hold such asset, or because we cannot convert the multilocation to an account.
- `FailedToDecode`: tied to the `Transact` instruction, in which the byte-blob representing the dispatchable cannot be decoded.
- `MaxWeightInvalid`: the weight specified in the `Transact` instruction is not sufficient to cover for the weight of the transaction.
- `TooExpensive`: Typically tied to `BuyExecution`, means that the amount of assets used to pay for fee is insufficient.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Identifying the error kind

- `Barrier`: One of the barriers failed, we need to check the barriers individually.
- `UnreachableDestination`: Arises when the supported XCM version of the destination chain is unknown.
  When the local chain sends an XCM to the destination chain for the very first time, it does not know about the XCM version of the destination.
  In such a case, the safe XCM version is used instead.
  However, if it is not set, then this error will be thrown.

## üî® Decoding SCALE-encoded messages

- **RelayChain**:
  - XCM can be retrieved in the `paraInherent.enter` inherent
  - The candidate for a specific parachain contains the ump messages sent to the relay.
  - **UMP messages are usually executed one block after they are received**
- **Parachain**:
  - XCM can be retrieved in the `parachainSystem.setValidationData` inherent.
  - **DMP and HRPM messages are usually executed in the block they are received**, at least, as long as the available weight permits.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## üî® Decoding SCALE-encoded messages

But all we see is a **SCALE-encoded message** which does not give us much information.
To solve this:

- We build a SCALE-decoder to retrieve the xcm message (the hard way).
- We rely on subscan/polkaholic to see the XCM message received.
