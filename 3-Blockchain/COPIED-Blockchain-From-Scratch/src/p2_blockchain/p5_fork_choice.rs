//! When forks arise in the blockchain, users need a way to decide which chain
//! they will consider best, for now. This is known as a "fork choice rule".
//! There are several meaningful notions of "best", so we introduce a trait
//! that allows multiple implementations.
//! 
//! Since we have nothing to add to the Block or Header data structures in this lesson,
//! we will import them from the previous lesson.

// well with this relatively simple trait definition. We will return to the GHOST
// rule later when we have written a full blockchain client
//
// The GHOST rule was first published in 2013 by Yonatan Sompolinsky and Aviv Zohar.
