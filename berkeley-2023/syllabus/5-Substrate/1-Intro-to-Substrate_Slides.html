needs of the future.</p>

### 🤩 Generic, Modular and Extensible Design

- Multiple consensus engines (BABE/Grandpa/AURA/PoW/Sassafras)

- Multiple database implementations (ParityDB, RocksDB)

<aside class="notes"><p>FRAME takes this even multiple steps further, but that&#39;s for later.</p>

- **Kulupu**: Proof of work, custom hashing.

<aside class="notes"><p>Substrate has been coded, from the ground up, such that it is easy to have multiple implementations
for certain functions. Heavy use of traits and generics is the key to achieve this. As noted,
Substrate has a lot of APIs, and optional implementations. You are bound to the API, but not the
particular implementation.</p>

## Consensus <> Runtime 🤔

- Yes, consensus is not a core part of a blockchain runtime. Why?
- Not part of your STF!
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- The consensus protocol is to your runtime what HTTP is to Facebook.

<aside class="notes"><p>comments from Joshy:</p>
<p>I think this is important. The runtime is the application you want to run.</p>
<p>Consensus is outside of this application helping us agree what the official state of this runtime
is. Last wave I used this analogy.</p>

points for future episodes. Any of their ideas could work. But eventually they need to agree what
the next episode to air actually will be.</p>

## Database <> State 🤔

<p>SMOLDOT is not exactly a substrate client. It is mainly designed to work with Polkadot. But with
minimal tweaks, you could make it work for more substrate based chains.</p>
<p>This has to do with the fact that consensus and a few other bits of the client and runtime are not
100% independent. For example, GRANDPA has a pallet on the runtime side, but is mostly in the
client. Now, a client that is configured with GRANDPA can only work with runtimes that are also
configured with GRANDPA.</p>

### Substrate and Smart Contracts

- So when should you write with a smart contract (Ink!) and when a Runtime (FRAME)?

<aside class="notes"><p>I was asked this yesterday as well. My latest answer is: if you don&#39;t need any of the customizations
that a blockchain client/runtime gives to you, and the performance of a shared platform is okay for
you, then go with a smart contract. If you need more, you need a &quot;runtime&quot; (some kind of chian,
parachain or solo)</p>
<p>An example of customization is that a runtime has access to <code>on_initialize</code> etc.</p>
<p>Also, a contract can not have fee-less transactions.</p>
<p>Also, a contract usually depends on a token for gas, while a runtime can be in principle token-less
fee-less.</p>

Substrate's Wasm Runtime

## Lecture Recap

- Substrate's design stems from 3 core principles:
  - **Rust**, **Generic Design**, **Upgradeability/Governance**
- Client / Runtime architecture
- State Transition
- Positive and negative consequences of Wasm
- Substrate next to Polkadot and other chains.
- Substrate for Smart Contracts.

## Recap: 🏦 Governance and Upgradeability

A timeless system must be:

1. Generic
2. Governable
3. Trust-less-ly Upgradeable.

Substrate's Wasm meta-protocol exactly enables the latest ✅

<aside class="notes"><p>Question: how would you put the meta-protocol of Substrate into words?</p>
<p>The client is basically a wasm meta-protocol that does only one thing. This meta-protocol is
hardcoded, but the protocol itself is flexible.</p>

## Appendix: What is Wasm Anyways?

> WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a _binary instruction format_ for a _stack-based virtual
> machine_. Wasm is designed as a _portable compilation_ target for programming languages, enabling

- Wasm ❤️ Web
- Streaming and rapid compilation.
- Designed with the concept of host in mind.
  Sandboxed, permissioned sys-calls.

> Anyone remember "Java Applets"?

### How to Write a Wasm Runtime?

- Any language that can compile to Wasm and exposes a fixed set of functions, to be used by the client.
- ... But, of course, Substrate comes with a framework to make this developer-friendly, **FRAME™️**.
