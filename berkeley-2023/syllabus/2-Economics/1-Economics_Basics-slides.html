#### Cryptography

- Provides assurances about the conduct of machines
- Objective in nature
- Promotes deterministic actions
- Serves as a toolbox to secure certain actions in the digital world.

#### Economics

- Offers predictions about the actions of people
- Intrinsically subjective
- Driven by individual preferences
- Serves as a toolbox to understand which actions humans are likely to undertake.

## Guiding Human Behavior

> An incentive is a bullet, a key:<br/>an often tiny object with astonishing power to change a situation.<br/>-- Steven Levitt --

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Human behavior is driven by incentives.</li>
<li>The aggregation of these behaviors lead to societies.</li>
<li>Carefully designing incentives lays the ground for functioning systems.</li>
<li>You might be asked to implement certain protocols, which you have to judge if they make sense / can be improved.</li>

## Understanding Incentives

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Motivate individuals or groups to perform certain actions.</li>
<li class="fragment">Historically, incentives were designed to influence human behavior both on a macroeconomic and microeconomic level.</li>
<li class="fragment">Most commonly, people refer to money, that fall under the umbrella of extrinsic incentives.</li>
<li class="fragment">But not all incentives are monetary!</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Different Types of Economic Incentives

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">In a workplace setting (microeconomic level), employees are often motivated by various forms of economic incentives:
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Flat Rate: A fixed amount of salary irrespective of performance.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Piece Rate: Pay based on the quantity of output produced.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Bonus: Additional rewards for excellent performance.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Relative Incentives: Rewards relative to the performance of others (competitive incentives).</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

<li><strong>Question: What are the advantages / disadvantages of those incentives?</strong></li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Rationality in Economics

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Economic theories often assume rationality, implying that actors:
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Are primarily driven by monetary gains (payoff maximization).</li>
    <li class="fragment">Act in self-interest.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Have unlimited cognitive resources.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li class="fragment">Remark: In this, all factors can be translated into monetary terms.</li>
</ul>

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Incentives often work well

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Interest rates set by central banks.</li>
<li class="fragment">Lower rates: Encourage borrowing and investing.</li>
<li class="fragment">Higher rates: Slow down inflation and stabilize the economy.</li>

## Incentives can Backfire

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">In India during British rule, the British Government was concerned about the large number of venomous Cobras.
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">They offered a bounty for every dead cobra.</li>
    <li class="fragment">People started to breed cobras at home to sell them.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Once the government stopped the program, breeders released the cobras causing larger numbers than before.</li>

## Crowding Out

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">In Haifa (Israel) parents often got their kids late from day care.</li>
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">This caused childcare workers frustration.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Idea: fine parents for getting their kids late.</li>
    <li class="fragment">The program was rolled out in some day cares and not others.</li>
    </ul>
<li class="fragment">Traditional economic theory:</li>
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Less or at least equally many late parents.</li>
    <li class="fragment">BUT: The opposite happened, the number of late parents even increased.</li>
    <li class="fragment">After the fine was abolished, parents still were more late.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li class="fragment">Extrinsic motivation can crowd out intrinsic motivation.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## The Power of Intrinsic Incentives

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Beyond monetary gain, people are also motivated by intrinsic factors.</li>
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Social preferences (Reciprocity, Fairness, Social Norms, Inequality Aversion, Altruism).</li>
    <li class="fragment">Personal morals, and deeply-held beliefs.</li>
    </ul>
<li class="fragment">Economic models often fail to account for these motivations, leading to unexpected outcomes in real-world applications.</li>
</ul>

## From Humans to Automated Agents

<pba-flex center>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">The digital age emphasizes the importance of automated actors in our economic systems.</li>
<li class="fragment">Algorithms and bots, respond to incentives, often financial ones, automatically.</li>
<li class="fragment">This shifts the application of incentives beyond a human context and into the realm of digital systems and automated processes.</li>
</ul>
</pba-flex>

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Still, not always financial incentives - reputation scores</li>
<li>While automated agents existed for a while, they become much more accessible for everybody due to blockchain technology</li>
<li>Your electric car might soon have a wallet that automatically pays for charging at a red light.</li>
<li>Or you might be able to pay for priority green lights.</li>

## Conclusion

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Incentives continue to be fundamental to interactions in society, whether among humans or between automated systems.</li>
<li class="fragment">As we understand more about incentives in different contexts, we can better design them to influence behavior effectively.</li>
<li class="fragment">Intrinsic motivations remain important, but in certain contexts, like automated systems, monetary incentives also play a significant role.</li>
<li class="fragment">The challenge is to balance these factors to achieve the desired outcomes.</li>

</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Law of Demand: A Basic Principle

- When prices increase, quantity demanded of a good (generally) decreases.

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li><strong>Question: Anybody know exceptions?</strong></li>
<li>Exception are &quot;Veblen goods&quot; where demand increases when price increases.
These are typically luxury goods that signal something (e.g. status, reputation) in addition to being useful to consumption.
Examples are jewelry, luxury cars, etc.</li>
<li>This is not a contradiction to the law of demand because the good&#39;s social value depends on the price; i.e., the good &quot;changes&quot; and becomes more desirable as the price increases.</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Visualizing Demand: The Demand Curve

<img rounded style="width:900px" src="./img/2.1-market-demand.png" />

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li><strong>Question: What influences the aggregate market demand?</strong></li>
<li>The market demand is the sum of all individual curves.</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Influences on demand?

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Price (Demand moves along the curve)</li>
<li class="fragment">Size of consumer base</li>
<li class="fragment">Average disposable income of consumer base</li>
<li class="fragment">Price of substitution goods</li>
<li class="fragment">Preferences prevalent within consumer base</li>
<li class="fragment">Expectations prevalent within consumer base</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>In the ice cream example, a substitution good could be frozen yoghurt: if its price goes down, the demand for ice cream will decrease.</li>
<li>If people&#39;s appetite for ice cream increases (perhaps via advertisement), the demand will increase.</li>
<li>In people expect a shortage of ice cream in the near future, the demand will increase immediately.</li>
</ul>

## Moving the demand curve

<img rounded style="width:1100px" src="./img/2.1-demand-curve.png" />
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Law of Supply: The Other Side of the Coin

- If the price of a good increases, the quantity supplied also increases

(because suppliers can make more profit!).

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>That is, assuming that suppliers manage to sell all produced goods at said price.</li>
<li>For example, if the ice cream price increases the store will hire a second employee to sell more scoops per hour.</li>
<li>As another example, some petroleum deposits are easier and cheaper to extract than others, so some deposits will be extracted only if the oil price is above a certain threshold.</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Demand and Supply Interplay: Market Equilibrium

<img rounded style="width: 600px;" src="./img/2.1-supply-and-demand.png" />

- What happens when Price is higher than the Eq. Price?
- What if the Quantity is lower than the Eq. Quantity?
- Moving either supply or demand leads to new Eq.

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Where the curves meet we obtain a point of equilibrium, which establishes a market quantity and a market price.</li>
<li>If price is higher than equilibrium price, there is more supply than demand, so some goods remain unsold, and sellers will be forced to reduce the price to get rid of their stock.
Similarly if the price is lower than equilibrium price, there is more demand than supply, which leads to shortages of the good; sellers will notice this and increase the price.
Hence, we always converge to the equilibrium price.</li>
<li>Similarly, if the quantity supplied is too low, there is a business opportunity to supply more unit of the good and make a profit, so eventually someone will increase the supply quantity.</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Elasticity

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Measures how much buyers and sellers respond to changes in market conditions.</li>
<li class="fragment">Sensitivity of quantity demanded or supplied to changes in price.</li>
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">High elasticity: small price changes have large impact on quantity demanded or supplied.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Low elasticity (== inelasticity): price changes do not affect quantity demanded or supplied.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Draw a diagram with price on y and quantity on x and draw an almost vertical line tilted towards the left.<ul>
<li>Demand for Gasoline.
Low elasticity: If price goes up people buy only a little less, if price goes up they only buy a little more.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>High Elasticity: luxury goods, where buyers can easily adjust their consumption.</li>
<li>Low Elasticity: essential goods such as energy / medicine.</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Conclusion: The Dynamics of Demand and Supply

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Demand/supply model forces in markets and can be used to estimate equilibrium quantity/price.</li>
<li class="fragment">All other things being equal:
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">demand decreases with increasing price.</li>
    <li class="fragment">supply increases with increasing price.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li class="fragment">There are different factors influencing supply & demand curves.
    <ul>

## Market forms

### (Or: why monopoly bad?)

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Typically, economists distinguish between three market forms.
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Perfect competition: Many firms, many consumers.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Oligopoly: Few firms, many consumers.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Monopoly: One firm, many consumers.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li class="fragment">The more competition a firm faces, the less market power it has.</li>
<li class="fragment">Market power: ability to affect the price (through choosing a certain production level).</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Special form of Oligopoly is the Duopoly with two firms, something that we see later.</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Market Form Examples

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Monopoly:
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Postal services in many European countries.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Railway services in many European countries.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li class="fragment">Oligopoly:
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Cloud provider (AWS, Google, ...)</li>
    <li class="fragment">Mobile phone service.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li class="fragment">Perfect Competition:
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Consumer products with low barrier to entry (e.g., kebab stand in Berlin, espresso bar in Italy)</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Why discuss this?

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Current web2 landscape consists of several firms with a lot of market power in their respective market segment.</li>
<li class="fragment">We want to understand, from an economic perspective, why too much market power is not a good thing.</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Perfect Competition

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Under perfect competition ...
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">there are so many firms that a single firm's production quantity does not affect market price.</li>
    <li class="fragment">the marginal costs (cost of one additional unit) of production equals the market price.</li>
    <li class="fragment">firms have 0 profit.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>This makes sense: The firm produces up to the point where an additional unit costs exactly what it gets for it on the market.</li>
<li>Notice that having the market price be equal to the marginal production costs is pretty surprising, as it is ideal from a point of view of society welfare, even though every firm is acting selfishly.</li>
<li>In this perfect world, firms will have zero economic profit, meaning they make just enough money to cover production costs and keep the company running.</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Monopoly

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Monopolist: single seller of the good or service, serves the entire market.</li>
<li class="fragment">Market characterized by a high barrier of entry (e.g. big investment, legal restrictions).</li>
<li class="fragment">Monopolist is therefore sole price-setter and serves only to maximize their own profits.</li>
<li class="fragment">This leads to sub-optimal pricing and sub-optimal society welfare: consumers either pay more than they should ("monopolist tax") or are excluded from market.</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Oligopolies

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Oligopolies are somewhere between monopolies and perfect competition.</li>
<li class="fragment">Because of the competition between firms
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">prices are lower, and</li>
    <li class="fragment">overall market participation is higher.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What did we learn?

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Markets differ in how much market power the firms possess.</li>
<li class="fragment">Economics typically distinguishes between three forms (ordered by increasing market power):
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Perfect competition: many firms in the market.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Oligopoly: few firms in the market.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Monopoly: one firm in the market.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li class="fragment">The problem of monopoly is the result of an inefficiently high price.</li>

## Economics of Specialization

#### _(or: why bother trading at all?)_

## Absolute vs Comparative Advantage

<li>What does that tell us about daily life?<ul>
<li><strong>Stick with what you are good at</strong>: It&#39;s often good to stick things where you have a comparative advantage: For example, assume you are a great software engineer with a job that has a high salary, but you also want to help clean up the ocean. Instead of giving up your job and go clean the ocean, you might want to allocate some of your salary to ocean cleanup, having a larger effect.</li>
<li><strong>Realize that absolute advantage is not all</strong>Only because one co-worker has a total advantage in two dimensions of the job, another co worker can still have the comparative advantage in one of the tasks.</li>

<pba-flex center>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Behavioral biases are systematic errors in decision-making when people use mental shortcuts (heuristics) to process information and make judgments.</li>
<li class="fragment">For a long time economic theory was built on the assumption that all actors are <em>rational</em>.
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment">No regard for fairness, altruism, equality.</li>
    <li class="fragment">All available information is considered.</li>
    <li class="fragment">No influence of emotions.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li class="fragment">This works well in many circumstances (e.g., on an aggregate level or assuming highly rational actors like firms executives) but in many it doesn't.</li>

## Behavioral Economics

<ul>
<li class="fragment"><strong><em>Behavior is not random!</em></strong></li>
<li class="fragment">Key behavioral biases include:
    <ul>
    <li class="fragment"><strong>Confirmation Bias</strong> - Decision makers focus on information that cater to their prior belief / opinion and neglect other information.</li>
    <li class="fragment"><strong>Sunk Cost Fallacy</strong> - Instead of cutting losses, decision makers continue to pour resources into a failed endeavour.</li>
    <li class="fragment"><strong>Herding Effect</strong> - People follow the crowd without making their own informed decision.</li>
    <li class="fragment"><strong>Gambler's Fallacy</strong> - In many situations probabilities of repeated events are independent from each other. Often decision makers fail to understand this.</li>
    <li class="fragment"><strong>Default Effect</strong> - People tend to stick with pre-selected choices.</li>
    <li class="fragment"><strong>Overconfidence</strong> - People overestimate their abilities.</li>

<li class="fragment">Any other biases you know?</li>
</ul>

</pba-flex>

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Confirmation bias especially pronounced in todays time where people get trapped in echo chambers fostered by algorithms that keep feeding you information that you want to hear.</li>
<li>Overconfidence: If asked, more than 50% of people think they drive above average.
BUT has also positive effects.
Sometimes overconfident people are better than others and statistically perform better in practice.</li>
<li>Anchoring Effect</li>
<li>Endowment Effect: This bias occurs when we overvalue something simply because we own it.</li>
<li>Hindsight Bias - This is the tendency to believe, after an outcome is already known, that you would have predicted or could have foreseen the outcome.
It is often referred to as the &quot;I knew it all along&quot; effect.</li>
<li>Availability Bias - People make decisions based on the information that is readily available to them, rather than the complete data set.
This bias can often lead to inaccurate conclusions.</li>

## Activities Today & Tomorrow

- You can earn points by applying the concepts presented in this course to similar situations when playing with/against your colleagues.
- In session 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3, you can increase your budget (starting at 0) during several economic games.
- We have a total budget of $2250 for this.
- The budget is split between all the games that we play and total points earned by all of you are dynamically adjusted to correspond to the budget.
- In 2.3, there is a big final: You can use your earnings to bid for amazing NFTs by a professional artist in an experimental auction setting.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Sign-in

- You will sign in to each of the games with your Polkadot wallet.
- You should always sign in with the same wallet to keep earning points to that wallet.
- Make sure not to forget your wallet credentials, because your final payout / NFT will be tied to that wallet.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Disclaimer

1. If a bug occurs and the reward points are messed up or something else goes wrong, we may intervene.
1. We cannot help you recovering your Polkadot wallet.
   If you lose access, you need to create a new account in the games but you will lose previous earnings.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Tracking your payoff

- Your balance is tracked in a wallet app.
- The points are translated to USD after each game.
- You can constantly check your balance by opening the wallet app link and sign in with your wallet.

## Game 1: Ultimatum game

- You are randomly matched with another student in the classroom.
- The interaction is anonymous.
- Player 1 gets an endowment of 100 points.
- Player 1 can offer Player 2 between 0 and 100 points.
- Player 2 sees the offer and can decide to accept or reject the offer.
- If the offer is accepted, the endowment is split according to the offer.
- If the offer is rejected, both get 0 points.
- Budget for the game $500.
- There is no right or wrong here.
  It is your choice how to behave in this context!

## Conclusion

We learned:

- fundamental economic concepts that are important to navigate in private- and professional life.
- the notion of rationality and what to expect from actors that behave this way.
- that especially human individuals deviate from rationality and behave differently.
- the importance of time on value.
- to engage in economic situations with other human actors.
