# Market Emergence

<aside class="notes"><p>And first let&#39;s take a look at something that hopefully very familiar: Markets</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Market Emergence

_"A market is a composition of systems, institutions, procedures, social relations or infrastructures whereby parties engage in exchange."_

<aside class="notes"><p>So a market is a composition of systems where ppl exchange stuff.
This is the simplest way of putting it.</p>
<p>And Markets are the cornerstone of our economy and they are everywhere which also means they are thoroughly studied.
Which is very fortunate for us.</p>
<p>Now let&#39;s look at something that might also be pretty familiar to many...</p>

<aside class="notes"><p>Let&#39;s dive a bit deeper.
So the users are bidding with how much they are willing to pay and miners are choosing the most lucrative transactions.
If miners already included all the best transactions and there are not many new ones coming in they need to start accepting lower fees, so the price drops.
But wait...?</p>

<aside class="notes"><p>It&#39;s the BLOCKSPACE.
Miners secure and produce blockspace and sell it in an auction to various users.
Blockspace as a product is actually a pretty new way of thinking about blockchains so I highly suggest checking out the article linked in the notes.</p>

<aside class="notes"><p>And now let&#39;s think of what normal markets do.
If our demand and price go extremely high the suppliers would have an incentive to produce more.
But in blockchains that&#39;s not directly possible.
More miners often don&#39;t mean more blockspace but MORE SECURE blockspace.
That means a better quality blockspace.</p>
<p>So the supply is often fixed and the demand is fluctuating.
This is often the cause for the very volatile fee market.</p>

<aside class="notes"><p>And according to that theory some large blockchains actually tried implementing variable size blocks to react to the demand, but it&#39;s a pretty complex task and a big tradeoff.</p>
<p>Some of you maybe recognize this image as the CryptoKitties game on Ethereum.
It&#39;s a game where you can buy and breed digital cats.
It was so popular that it actually clogged the Ethereum network and made normal transactions nearly unfeasible.
And maybe now you have some additional insights into what actually happened there.</p>

What&#39;s the Nash Equilibrium of Bitcoin mining? Is it being honest or dishonest?</p>

then there are no ACTUAL bitcoins being mined.
Remember that they don&#39;t cooperate but for instance try and push blocks with 9999 BTC in their account.

<aside class="notes"><p>If both are working honestly and making valid blocks they have an equal chance to mine a block and reap the rewards.
Rest of the nodes will accept those blocks but the two miners compete for the same resource so each one will get a single BTC on average (as the mining reward is 2).</p>

<aside class="notes"><p>If one of them is dishonest the other one can still keep working honestly and reap greater rewards as there is no competition.
In that case the honest party gains 2 BTC.</p>

#### _Network Effect_

_"The network effect is a business principle that illustrates the idea that when more people use a product or service,
its value increases."_

<aside class="notes"><p>Generally the more ppl use some platform or believe in something the more valuable it is.
It&#39;s a pretty simple concept but it&#39;s very important in the blockchain space.
Bitcoin is precious to many because many people believe in it and mine it and exchange it.
In blockchains if more people use your chain it&#39;s more valuable.</p>

<strong>Assumptions revisited:</strong>
<ul>
    <li style="color: grey;"> Only 2 miners </li>
    <li style="color: grey;"> Block reward = 2 </li>
    <li style="color: grey;"> Difficulty scales linearly with number of honest miners </li>
    <li style="color: grey;"> Miners are rational actors </li>
    <li style="color: grey;"> Dishonest miners do not cooperate </li>
    <li> Token price scales quadratically with the number of honest miners

            <li>1 honest miner -> 1$</li>
            <li>2 honest miners -> 4$</li>
    </li>
</ul>

<aside class="notes"><p>Let&#39;s add this extra assumption into our model.
If there are more miners securing the network the coins itself are more valuable.
We will use a super simple model here where the price of a coin is a square of the number of miners.
We will be investigating small systems so it is a good enough approximation.</p>

Not always.
If the majority of people are honest then honesty pays off.

- Service to the protocol needs to be rewarded
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Destructive or interfering actions need to be punished

- Limit the information the attackers have access to so they cannot plan ahead
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

<aside class="notes"><p>So let&#39;s ask ourselves what was the problem? The attackers learned everything about the game and could use this information before the validators could respond.
The information is the weapon.</p>
<p>=fragment=
If we could somehow limit the information the game would change in our favour.
We need to make this a game of incomplete information, where some things are hidden.</p>

## Complete vs Incomplete Information Games

#### _Polkadot Approval Voting_

**Improved Scenario**

- Each validator uses a VRF to generate a random number
- Validators with a sufficiently small number will have the right to be Approval Checkers
- Approval Checkers reveal themselves by showing their low numbers and publish a vote at the same time <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- If all the votes received confirm the block is fine it passes <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Let&#39;s imagine this new improved scenario.
Each validator uses a VRF to generate a random number.</li>
<li>There is some threshold and validators with a sufficiently small number will have the right to be Approval Checkers.</li>
</ul>
<p>=fragment=</p>
<ul>
<li>Approval Checkers reveal themselves by showing their low numbers (with a vrf proof attached) and publish a vote at the same time.
If all the votes received confirm the block is fine it passes.</li>
</ul>
<p>This method has this nice property that attackers don&#39;t learn who the approval checkers are until they reveal themselves.
So they cannot plan ahead.</p>

## Complete vs Incomplete Information Games

#### _Polkadot Approval Voting_

**What can the Attackers do?**

- They no longer know who the Approval Checkers are so they have to guess
- If they don't guess correctly they get heavily slashed

<aside class="notes"><p>So what can the attackers do? If they can no longer target DDoS they only can attack at random.
This vastly reduces their chances of success and makes thm vulnerable to punishment if they fail.</p>
<p>This is pretty much the method used in Polkadot and it&#39;s called a VRF based random assignment.
It&#39;s a game of incomplete information.</p>

#### _Extra Examples_

- BABE is a Polkadot mechanism for selecting new block producers (further covered in Polkadot module).
  It also uses a similar VRF scheme to generate random assignments

<aside class="notes"><p>Some other notable examples you will learn about in later modules are connected to BABE the Polkadot mechanism for selecting new block producers.

# Shifting Assumptions

<aside class="notes"><p>By now you might have noticed a pattern that usually we have a list of assumptions.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Shifting Assumptions

<pba-cols>
    <pba-col>
        Every game has some assumptions that need to be made before reasoning about them.
        <ul>
            <li>Number of players</li>
            <li>Available actions</li>
            <li>Access to information</li>
            <li>etc</li>
        </ul>
    </pba-col>
    <pba-col>
        <img style="width: 200px" src="./img/econ-game-theory/assumptions.drawio.svg" alt="Board with assumptions" />
    </pba-col>
</pba-cols>

<aside class="notes"><p>Some of the assumptions are connected to the number of players or maybe the access to information.
And they are usually pretty stable.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Shifting Assumptions

<pba-cols>
    <pba-col>
        If any of the assumptions change the game changes as well.
        Old incentives that were previously sensible may now motivate a vastly different behavior.

    </pba-col>
</pba-cols>

<aside class="notes"><p>What happens when for some reason the assumptions evolve and change?
The game changes as well.
Old incentives that were previously sensible may now motivate a vastly different behavior.</p>

## Shifting Assumptions

#### _Restaking_

<pba-cols>
    <pba-col>
        Restaking through EigenLayer incentives Ethereum stakers to stake the same funds for multiple apps at the same time.
        <br/><br/>
        The incentive game will be vastly different and the capital will effectively be leveraged (double risk and double rewards).
    </pba-col>
    <pba-col>
        <img style="width: 600px" src="./img/econ-game-theory/eigen.drawio.png" alt="EigenLayer Logo" />
    </pba-col>
</pba-cols>

<aside class="notes"><p>A super good example of that is what is very recently happening in Ethereum.
And I mean literally this month.
There is a new layer 2 protocol called EigenLayer that allows stakers to stake the same funds for multiple apps at the same time.
This is called restaking.</p>
<p>This is not something natively available in Ethereum and it wasn&#39;t taken into consideration when slashes/rewards were designed.</p>

        Restaking consequences are still not fully understood and the research is ongoing.

<aside class="notes"><p>The consequences of restaking are still not fully understood and the research is ongoing.
I encourage you to read the speaker notes for further reading.
The whole field of blockchain incentivization and protocol design is still developing so there are many unknowns but overall I hope all the methods shown today help you in making more informed decisions later down the line.
Thats it...</p>
