<p>Welcome to the realm of Web 2.0, where the majority of web applications currently reside.

As it stands, our entry into the blockchain network is channeled through a central access point, represented by a JSON-RPC node.
This node serves as the gateway to access the entire blockchain network.</p>
<p>While many applications claim to be decentralized, we must ask ourselves, how truly decentralized are they?</p>
<p>Now, I want to emphasize one crucial point - and I encourage you to take a moment to reflect on it.

# Node types in the network

<p style="text-align: left; padding-bottom: 2rem">The type of each node depends on different characteristics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <span class="font-bold underline">Validator:</span> node configured to potentially produce blocks.
  </li>
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
  <li>
    <span class="font-bold underline">JSON-RPC:</span> node which gives public access to its JSON-RPC endpoint.
  </li>
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
  <li>
    <span class="font-bold underline">Bootnode:</span> node whose address can be found in the chain specification file (chainspec).
      Necessary to kick-off the network.
  </li>
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
  <li>
    <span class="font-bold underline">Archive:</span> stores the entire state of the chain at each block since block #0.

</ul>

<aside class="notes"><p>Before anything else – lets remember the node types in the network</p>
<p>Validator Nodes: These nodes are responsible for producing new blocks and validating transactions.
They participate in the consensus mechanism and play a crucial role in securing the network.</p>
<p>JSON-RPC nodes: serve as an interface for developers and applications to interact with the blockchain by sending JSON-formatted requests and receiving JSON-formatted responses.</p>
<p>Bootnodes: Bootnodes are nodes with well-known addresses that serve as entry points for new nodes joining the network.
They help new nodes discover and connect to other peers in the network.</p>
<p>Light Nodes: Light nodes are a lightweight version of full nodes that do not store the entire blockchain but rely on full nodes for transaction verification.
They are useful for users who want to interact with the network without the need to download the entire blockchain.</p>
<p>(......After the Clicks!....)</p>
<p>Any combination of “validator”, “bootnode” and “JSON-RPC node” is possible, except for “light” and “archive” that are mutually incompatible.</p>

# What is a light client?

<ul>
  <li>
    It is a client that is lighter than a full node, in terms of memory consumption, number of threads, and code size;</li>
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
  <li> Allows a dApp to access and interact with a blockchain in a secure and decentralized manner without having to sync the full blockchain;</li>

<aside class="notes"><p>In the next slides we will explain &quot;What is a light client&quot; in a generic manner but also I will add some extra information around the Polkadot ecosystem solution that is implemented;</p>
<p>Bullet 1) A &quot;light client&quot; is a type of node implementation that allows applications to interact with the network, consuming fewer resources compared to full nodes, making them more suitable for resource-constrained devices like mobile phones, or light enough for running in browsers (see substrate connect);</p>
<p>Bullet 2) Instead of maintaining a complete copy of the blockchain, the node only carries a minimal amount of data necessary for its operations (e.g.chain specs).
It relies on full nodes or other network participants to provide the additional information it needs;</p>
<p>Bullet 3) ....
based on the request it either provides the response from existing data, if any, or propagates the request to a full node and returns the response;</p>
<p>Bullet 4) Light clients can synchronize with the blockchain more quickly since they only need to fetch recent data, using justifications (we will talk about it in a while), reducing the time needed to get up-to-date with the network (few seconds).
They fetch less data from the network and consume less bandwidth.
This is especially advantageous for users on limited data plans or slow internet connections</p>

<aside class="notes"><p>As you probably already learned a chain specification is a configuration file that defines the parameters and initial settings for a blockchain network.</p>
<p>It serves as a blueprint for launching and running a new blockchain node, providing essential information to set up the network;</p>
<p>Our Substrate nodes can produce what is called a Chain spec which Smoldot then uses in order to spin up a light client node based on that chain-spec;

### How does a light client know what/who to trust

<img rounded style="margin-top: 150px; width: 70%" src="./img/know-who-to-trust.png" />
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

<aside class="notes"><p>As we know Substrate chains provides the concept of FINALITY which is VERY important for the light clients!
Once a block has been finalized, it is guaranteed to always be part of the best chain.
By extension, the parent of a finalized block is always finalized as well etc etc
For finality Substrate/Polkadot nodes use the GrandPa algorithm.
Authorized nodes, emit votes on the network, when 2/3rds or more have voted for a specific block, it effectively becomes finalized.
These votes are been collected in what is called a <strong>justification</strong></p>
<p><strong>Justifications</strong> play a crucial role in providing security and validity guarantees for light clients.
As said before, light clients are nodes that do not store blockchain&#39;s data but rely on other full nodes or the network to verify the blockchain&#39;s state and transactions.
While light clients offer reduced resource requirements and faster synchronization, they face the challenge of trusting the information they receive from other nodes.</p>
<p>Justifications address this trust issue for light clients by providing cryptographic proofs of the finality and validity of blocks.
When a block is justified, it means that it has been confirmed and agreed upon by a supermajority of validators, making it part of the finalized state of the blockchain.</p>
<p>It is also used by nodes who might not have received all the votes, or for example if they were offline, In order to verify the authenticity of the blocks;</p>
<p>A Light client receives these justifications and this way it verifies the authenticity of a block.</p>

#### Known vulnerabilities

- Eclipse attacks (Full node & Light client)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Long-range attacks (Full node & Light client)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Invalid best block (Only Light client)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- Finality stalls (Mostly Light client)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

<aside class="notes"><p>Stay with me - the next is the last but not the easiest part:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Eclipse attacks (full nodes and light clients both affected)</strong>.
Blockchain is a P2P network - and Smoldot tries to connect to a variety of nodes of this network (from the bootnodes).
Imagine if all these nodes were to refuse sending data back, that would isolate smoldot from the network - The way that smoldot learns which nodes exist, is from the nodes themselves (bootnodes).
If smoldot is only ever connected to malicious nodes, it won&#39;t ever be able to reach non-malicious nodes - if the list of bootnodes only contains malicious nodes, smoldot will never be able to reach any non-malicious node.
If the list of bootnodes contains a single honest node, then smoldot will be able to reach the whole network.
!!! this attack is effectively a denial-of-service, as it will prevent smoldot from accessing the blockchain!</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Long-range attacks (full nodes and light clients both affected)</strong>.
If more than 2/3rds of the validators collaborate, they can fork a chain, starting from a block where they were validator, even if they are no longer part of the active validators at the head of the chain.
If some validators were to fork a chain, the equivocation system would punish them by stealing their staked tokens.
However, they cannot be punished if they unstake their tokens (which takes 7 days for Kusama or 28 days for Polkadot) before creating the fork.</p>
<p>If smoldot hasn&#39;t been online since the starting point of the fork, it can be tricked (through an eclipse attack) into following the false fork.
In order to not be vulnerable, smoldot shouldn&#39;t stay offline for more than the unstaking delay time (as said 7 days for Kusama or 28 days for Polkadot) in a row.
Alternatively, smoldot isn&#39;t vulnerable if the checkpoint provided in the chain specification, is not older than the unstaking delay.</p>
<p>Given that this attack -&gt; requires the collaboration of many validators, -&gt; is &quot;all-in&quot;, -&gt; is detectable ahead of time, -&gt; it requires being combined with an eclipse attack, and that it doesn&#39;t offer any direct reward, it is considered not a realistic threat.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Invalid best block (light clients only)</strong>.
Light clients don&#39;t verify validity but only authenticity of blocks.</p>
<p>A block is authentic if it has been authored by a legitimate validator, at a time when it was authorized to author a block.
A validator could author a block that smoldot considers as authentic, but that contains completely arbitrary data.</p>
<p>Invalid blocks aren&#39;t propagated by honest full nodes on the gossiping network, but it is possible for the validator to send the block to the smoldot instance(s) that are directly connected to it or its complicit.
While this attack requires a validator to be malicious and that it doesn&#39;t offer any direct reward it is unlikely to happen, but it is still a realistic threat.
For this reason, when using a light client, do not assume any storage data coming from a best, that hasn&#39;t been finalized yet to be accurate.</p>
<p>Once a block has been finalized, it means that at least 2/3rds of the validators consider the block valid.
While it is still possible for a finalized block to be invalid, this would require the collaboration of 2/3rds of the validators.
If that happens, then the chain has basically been taken over, and whether smoldot shows inaccurate data <strong>doesn&#39;t really matter anymore</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Finality stalls (mostly light clients)</strong>.
Because any block that hasn&#39;t been finalized yet can become part of the canonical chain in the future, a node, in order to function properly, needs to keep track of all the valid (for full nodes) or authentic (for light clients) non-finalized blocks that it has learned the existence of.
Under normal circumstances, the number of such blocks is rather low (typically 3 blocks).
If, however, blocks cease to be finalized but new blocks are still being authored, then the memory consumption of the node will slowly increase over time for each newly-authored block until there is no more memory available and the node is forced to stop.
Substrate mitigates this problem by forcing blocks authors to gradually slow down the blocks production when the latest known finalized block is too far in the past.
Since it is normally not possible for finality to stall unless there is a bug or the chain is misconfigured, this is not really an attack but rather the consequences of an attack.
Full nodes are less affected by this problem because they typically have more memory available than a light client, and have the possibility to store blocks on the disk.</p>
