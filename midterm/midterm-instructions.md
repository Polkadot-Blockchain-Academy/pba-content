# Midterm Assignment for the Polkadot Blockchain Academy

This assignment is intended to assess your understanding of the core concepts in Modules 1, 2 and 3. This assignment consists of taking an existing white paper and dissecting it to explain the core concepts underlying its logic, using what you have learnt in the first three modules.

You will work in groups of 5-6 to complete this project and each group will be assigned a whitepaper to analyse.

## Project Prompt

Over the past weeks, we have covered many of the core technologies and concepts underscoring the power of Blockchain; concepts in economics, governance, cryptography.

In this midterm project, you will work with a small group to reverse engineer a blockchain project and evaluate how a real blockchain project addresses the following topics:

- Cryptography (Primitives, Digital Signatures, Hashing, Tries)
- Tokenomics (Market Economics, Token Utility, Token Allocation,Token Distribution)
- Governance (Collective Decision Making, Voting Systems)
- Blockchain Guarantees (Liveness, Censorship-resistance, Fairness)
- Blockchain Structure (Consensus Algorithm, State Machine)
- Blockchain Security (Threat Models)

For your assignment, your group is tasked to provide an evaluation as well as an analysis for each topic which you will be presenting to evaluators as part of your assignment.

Use the template slide deck ([Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QvDGEJ3arbvmwuhll8CYtKDHQQG3OvY8oCKxyBkFykM/edit?usp=sharing) or [Reveal.js](./midterm-slide-template.md)) to structure your presentation. For each topic, follow the prompts to structure your slides and write your evaluation and analysis. The goal for you to demonstrate the concepts youâ€™ve learnt in class and explain what elements particularly work well and which you would like to improve.
