## References

<!--
Compile an **annotated** list of URLs to source material referenced in making these lessons.
Ideally this is exhaustive, it can be cleaned up before delivery to students, but must include _why_ a reference is used.
For example:

- [ss58-registry](https://github.com/paritytech/ss58-registry) - A list of known SS58 account types as an enum, typically used by the Polkadot, Kusama or Substrate ecosystems.
- [wiki on parathreads](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-parathreads) - A description of the parathread model.
