# Polkadot Blockchain Academy

## NOTE: Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) should use [./CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn how to use this repo.

The Polkadot Blockchain Academy is an intensive academic program teaching Blockchain, Substrate and Polkadot to talented developers.

This program aims at:

- Improving our core dev hiring pipeline in both quantity and quality of candidates
- Seeding the industry with Substrate knowledge and advocates
- Building a surplus of devs for lesser product prototyping if theyâ€™re not hired out
- Improving our non-dev onboarding processes

Selected through an admission process, candidates will receive an intensive education taught by a mix of professionals from Parity, Web3 and some visiting professors.

## Rollout Plan

We are launching the first wave this Summer in the UK with a target of 50 students before growing to three in-person waves of 100 students each in rotating geographies.

| Cohort | Location  | Dates |
| ------ | --------- | ----- |
| 1      | Cambridge | TBD   |
| 2      | TBD       | TBD   |
