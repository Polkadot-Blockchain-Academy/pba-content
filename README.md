# Polkadot Blockchain Academy

The Polkadot Blockchain Academy is an intensive academic program teaching Blockchain, Substrate and Polkadot to talented developers.

This program aims at:

- Improving our core dev hiring pipeline in both quantity and quality of candidates
- Seeding the industry with Substrate knowledge and advocates
- Building a surplus of devs for lesser product prototyping if they’re not hired out
- Improving our non-dev onboarding processes

Selected through an admission process, candidates will receive an intensive education taught by a mix of professionals from Parity, Web3 and some visiting professors.
