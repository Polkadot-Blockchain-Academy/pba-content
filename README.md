# Polkadot Blockchain Academy

The Polkadot Blockchain Academy is an intensive academic program teaching Blockchain, Substrate and Polkadot to talented developers.

This program aims at:

- Improving our core dev hiring pipeline in both quantity and quality of candidates
- Seeding the industry with Substrate knowledge and advocates
- Building a surplus of developers for lesser product prototyping if theyâ€™re not hired out
- Improving our non-dev onboarding processes

Selected through an admission process, candidates will receive an intensive education taught by a mix of professionals from Parity, Web3 and some visiting professors.

## Venue Suggestions

This curriculum is designed to be taught as an in-person course with ~25-60 students. (Although it may be somewhat useful for online or independent learning). The venue where the course is taught should provide the following. These may be a single space with flexible seating, or two different spaces for lecture- and collaboration-style work.

- Overhead projector that all students can easily see
- Aisles for instructors to easily move among students to answer questions or help debug
- Group work stations where student groups of 5-10 students can gather
- A large whiteboard for instructors to share diagrams
- Internet connection that can support >10Mbps while all students are connected
- LAN connection that allows P2P connections to start a private blockchain network
